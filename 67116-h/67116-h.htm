Cruice.</span>
1. <span class="smcap">These</span> are the contents of the 6th (book) of the
<i>Refutation of all Heresies</i>.</p>

<p>2. What Simon has dared, and that his doctrine is
confirmed (by quotations) from magicians and poets.</p>

<p>3. What Valentinus has laid down, and that his doctrine
is not framed from the Scriptures, but from those of the
Platonists and Pythagorists.</p>

<p>4. And what is thought by Secundus, Ptolemy and
Heracleon, and how they have used as their own, but with
different words, the thoughts of those whom the Greeks
(think) wise.</p>

<p>5. What has been held by Marcus and Colarbasus [and
their disciples] and that some of them gave heed to magic
arts and Pythagorean numbers.</p>

<p>6. Now such opinions as belong to those who have taken
their principles from the serpent<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, when the time
arrived, of their own accord brought their doctrines into
light, we have set forth in the Book before this, being the
<span class="sidenote">p. 243.</span>
Vth of the <i>Refutation of all Heresies</i>. Here, however, I will
not keep silence as to the opinions of those who come after
(them),<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but will leave not one unrefuted, if it be possible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
to keep them all in mind, together with their secret rites
which are justly to be called orgies, inasmuch as those who
dare such things are not far from God’s wrath<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;to use the
word in its etymological sense.</p>


<h3 id="VI_1">1. <i>About Simon.</i></h3>

<p>7. It seems then right now to set forth also the (doings)
of Simon,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the man of Gitto,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a village of Samaria, whereby
we shall show that those also who followed (him) taking
hints from other names have ventured upon like things.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
This Simon, being skilled in magic arts and having played
upon many, sometimes by the Thrasymedean<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> process in the
way we have set forth above, but sometimes working iniquity
by means of devils, designed to deify himself, (although
only) a human sorcerer filled with desperation whom the
<span class="sidenote">p. 244.</span>
Apostles refuted in the <i>Acts</i>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Than whom Apsethus
the Libyan was much wiser and more modest when he
ambitiously attempted to be considered a god in Libya.
Whose story as it is not very different from the vain desire
of Simon, it seems fitting to narrate as one worthy to have
been attempted by Simon himself.</p>

<p>8. Apsethus the Libyan yearned to become a god.
But since, after making himself very busy, he utterly failed
(to accomplish) his desire, he wished at all events to
appear to have become one, and seemed as if he might
really effect this in course of time. For the foolish Libyans
sacrificed to him as to some divine power, thinking that
they must give faith to a voice from heaven above. For he
collected and shut up in one and the same cage a great
many of the birds called parrots; there being many parrots
in Libya who imitate quite clearly the human voice. For
some time he fed the birds and taught them to say
“Apsethus is a god”: and when the birds had been
<span class="sidenote">p. 245.</span>
trained for a long time, and repeated the saying which he
thought would make Apsethus be considered a god, he
opened the cage and let the parrots out in all directions.
The noise of the flying birds went forth into all Libya,
and their words reached as far as the land of the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
And thus the Libyans being wonderstruck by the voices of
the birds and not understanding the trick played by
Apsethus, held him for a god. But a certain Greek having
carefully studied the clever device of the so-called god, not
only refuted him by the (mouth of the) same parrots but
removed from the earth that human quack and rascal.
The Greek shut up many of the parrots and taught them to
say instead (of their former speech): “Apsethus shut us up
and forced us to say: ‘Apsethus is a god.’” And the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Libyans hearing the parrots’ recantation (and) all assembling
with one mind burned Apsethus.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>9. This (sort of man) one must suppose Simon the
magician (to be), so that we would far sooner liken him to
the Libyan who was born a man than to (Him) who is
really God.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But if the details of the likeness be held
accurate and the magician had some such passion as
Apsethus, we will undertake to teach Simon’s parrots that
Simon who stood, stands and will stand was not Christ, but
<span class="sidenote">p. 246.</span>
a man (sprung) from seed, born of a woman<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> begotten from
blood and fleshly desire like the rest, and that he knew this
to be so, we shall easily show as the story goes on.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But
Simon, stupidly and clumsily garbling the Law of Moses&mdash;for
when Moses has said that God was “a burning and
consuming fire,”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;he, not having received Moses’ saying
rightly, says that fire is the principle of the universals, and
not having comprehended the saying that God is not Fire,
but a burning and consuming fire, (thereby) not only rends
in twain the Law of Moses, but steals from Heraclitus
the Obscure.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But Simon proclaims that the principle of
the universals is a boundless power, speaking thus:&mdash;“This
is the writing of the Announcement<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of Voice and Name
from the Thought of the great power of the Boundless One.
Wherefore it will be sealed up, hidden, concealed and will
be in the dwelling-place where the root of the universals is
founded.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But he says that the dwelling-place is the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
man who has been begotten from blood and that the
<span class="sidenote">p. 247.</span>
Boundless Power dwells in him, which (power) he says is
the root of the universals. But the Boundless Power, the
fire according to Simon, is not simple as the many say
who think that the four elements are simple and that fire
is simple; but there is a certain double nature of fire, and
of this double nature he calls one part hidden and the
other manifest. But the hidden (parts) have been hidden
in the manifest parts of the fire, and the manifest have come
into being by the hidden. This it is which Aristotle calls
potentiality and action, and Plato the comprehensible and
the perceptible.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>And the manifest (part) of the fire contains within itself
all which one can perceive<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> or which can escape one, but
remains visible; but the hidden (part) contains everything
which one can perceive as something intelligible but which
evades the sense or which as not being thoroughly understood
one passes over. But it must be said generally that
of all things which are perceptible and intelligible, which
Simon calls hidden and manifest,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the supercelestial fire is
the Treasure-house,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> like unto the great tree which was seen
by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream, from which all flesh is fed.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 248.</span>
And he considers the trunk, the boughs, the leaves, and the
bark on the outside of it to be the manifest part of the fire.
All these things which are attached to the great tree the
flame of the all-devouring fire causes to vanish. But the
fruit of the tree, if it be made a perfect likeness<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and has
received its own shape, is placed in a storehouse and not in
the fire. For the fruit, he says, has been produced that it
may be put in a storehouse, but the chaff that it may be
cast into the fire, which (chaff) is the trunk which has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
not been produced for its own sake, but for that of the
fruit.</p>

<p>10. And this is, he says, what is written in the Scripture:
“The vine of the Lord Sabaoth is the house of Israel, and a
man of Judah his beloved plant.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But if a man of Judah
is his beloved plant, it proves, he says, that a tree is nothing
else than a man. But of its secretion and dissolution, he
says, the Scripture has spoken sufficiently, and for the
instruction of those who have been made completely after
(its) likeness,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the saying is enough that: “All flesh is grass
and all the glory of the flesh as the flower of grass. The
grass withereth and the flower fadeth away: but the word
<span class="sidenote">p. 249.</span>
of the Lord abideth for ever.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But the word, he says, is
the word and speech of the Lord born in the mouth, save
which there is no other place of generation.</p>

<p>11. But, to be brief, since the fire is such according to
Simon, and all things are seen and unseen as they are
heard and unheard, numbered and unnumbered, in the
<i>Great Announcement</i> he calls a perfect intellectual<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> every
one of those (beings) which can be boundlessly conceived
by the mind in a boundless way<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and can speak and think
and act, as says Empedocles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For earth by earth we see, and water by water</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And (divine) æther by æther, yet destroying fire by fire,</div>

    <div class="right">(Karsten, v. 321.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>12. For, he says, he considered all the parts of the fire
which are invisible to have sense and a share of mind.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 250.</span>
Therefore the cosmos, he says, came into being begotten
by the unbegotten fire. But it began to be, he says, after
this fashion:&mdash;He who was produced from the beginning
from that fire took six roots, the first ones of the principle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of generation.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And he says that the roots came from the
fire in pairs, which roots he calls Mind and Thought,
Voice and Name, Reasoning and Passion,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but that the
whole of the Boundless Power together is in these six roots
potentially, but not actively. The which Boundless Power
he says is He who Stood, Stands, and will Stand. Who
if he be made into a complete image (of the fire) will be
in substance, power, greatness, and effect one and the same
with that Unbegotten and Boundless Power, and lacking
nothing possessed by that unbegotten and unchanging and
infinite power. But if he remains potentially only in the
six powers and is not made into a complete image (of the
fire), he is done away with and is lost like as the capacity
for grammar or geometry in man’s soul. For power taking
<span class="sidenote">p. 251.</span>
to itself skill becomes a light of the things which are:
but if it does not take unto itself (skill) it is unskilfulness
and darkness and as if it were not, it perishes<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> with the
man at his death.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
13. But of these six powers and the seventh which is
with the six, he calls the first pair, (to wit) Nous and
Epinoia, Heaven and Earth. And (he says) that the
masculine (partner) looks down from on high upon and
takes thought for his spouse and that the Earth below
receives the intellectual fruits proper to her brought down
from Heaven to Earth. Wherefore, he says, the Logos
beholding often the things born from Nous and Epinoia,
that is from Heaven and Earth, says: “Hear, O Heaven,
and give ear, O Earth, for the Lord has spoken. I have
begotten and raised up sons, but they have disregarded
me.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He who thus speaks, he says, is the Seventh Power
who Stood, Stands and will Stand. For he is the cause
of those fair things which Moses praised and said that
<span class="sidenote">p. 252.</span>
they were very good. And Phone and Onoma are the
Sun and Moon, and Logismos and Enthymesis Air and
Water. But with all these is mingled and compounded,
as I have said, the great and Boundless Power, He who
has Stood.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>14. Since, therefore, Moses spake: “In six days God
created Heaven and Earth and the seventh day he rested
from all his works,”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Simon after re-arranging the passage,
makes himself out a god. When then they say that three
days passed before the Sun and Moon existed,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> they
shadow forth Nous and Epinoia and the Seventh Power,
the Boundless One. For these three powers were born
before all the others. When they say: “Before all the Aeons
He has begotten me,”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (Simon) says that this was spoken of
the Seventh Power. But the same Seventh Power, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
was a power existing in the Boundless Power which was
begotten before all the Aeons, this is, he says, the Seventh
Power of whom Moses said: “And the Spirit of God was
borne above the water,”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that is, he says, the spirit containing
<span class="sidenote">p. 253.</span>
all things within itself, an image of the Boundless Power,
of whom Simon says “image of the imperishable form
which alone orders all things.” For that power which was
borne above the water having come into being, he says,
from the imperishable form, alone orders all things. Now
when some such and like preparations of the cosmos had come
to pass, God, he says, moulded<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> man, taking dust from the
earth. But he fashioned him not simple but twofold<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> according
to image and resemblance. But the spirit which was
borne above the water is an image, which spirit if it is not
made a complete likeness,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> perishes with the world, as it
abides only potentially and does not exist in activity.
This, he says, is the saying, “Lest ye be judged with the
world.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But if it be made a complete likeness and is
born from an Indivisible Point as it is written in the
Announcement, the small will become great. But it will
be great in the Boundless and Unchanging Aeon, being
born no more.</p>

<p>How then and in what manner, he says, did God form
man in Paradise? For this is his opinion. Let, he says,
Paradise be the womb, and that this is true the Scripture
teaches when it says: “I am he who fashioned thee in thy
mother’s womb.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> For this also he wishes to be thus
<span class="sidenote">p. 254.</span>
written. Moses, he says, speaking in allegory, calls
Paradise the womb if we are to believe the word. But if
God fashions man in the womb of his mother, that is, in
Paradise, as I have said, let Paradise be the womb and
Edem the placenta: “And a river went forth from Edem
and watered Paradise”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> (this is) the navel-string. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
navel-string, he says, separates into four heads. For on
each side of the navel are set two arteries, conduits of
breath, and two veins, conduits of blood. But when he
says, the navel-string goes forth from the placenta it takes
root in the infant by the epigastrium which all men
commonly call the navel. And the two veins it is through
which flows and is borne from Edem (the placenta) the
blood to the so-called gates of the liver whence the child
is fed. But the arteries as we have said, are the conduits
of the breath<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which pass behind on either side of the
bladder round the pelvis and make connection with the
great artery by the spine called the aorta, and thus through
the ventricles the breath flows upon the heart and causes
<span class="sidenote">p. 255.</span>
movement of the embryo. For the embryo in course of
formation in Paradise neither takes food by the mouth,
nor breathes through the nostrils. For, as it exists amid
waters, death is at its feet if it should breathe. For it
would then draw in the waters and die. But it is girt about
almost wholly by the envelope called the amnion and is
fed through the navel, and through the aorta which is by
the spine, it receives, as I have said<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the substance of the
breath.</p>

<p>15. Therefore, he says, the river flowing forth from Edem
separates into four heads (or) four conduits, that is, into the
child’s four senses, sight, smell, taste, and touch. For the
infant while being formed in Paradise has these senses only.
This, he says, is the Law which Moses laid down; and
agreeably with that same Law each of the Books is written,
as their titles clearly show. The first book (is) <i>Genesis</i>
(and) the title of the book, he says, suffices for the knowledge
of the universals. For, he says, this is genesis, that
is sight into which one of the sections of the river separates;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 256.</span>
for the world is seen by sight. The title of the second
book is <i>Exodus</i>. For that which is born after crossing the
Red Sea comes into the Desert&mdash;he calls the blood, he
says, the Red Sea&mdash;and tastes bitter water. For bitter, he
says, is the water which comes after the Red Sea, which
(water) is the way of knowledge of life pursued through
painful and bitter things. But when changed by Moses,
that is by the Logos, that bitter (water) becomes sweet.
And that this is so, can be known by all in common in the
saying of the poets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Black was it at the root, but the flower was like milk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gods call it Moly, but hard it is to dig</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For mortal men, but to the gods all things are possible.&mdash;</div>
    <div class="right">(<span class="smcap">Homer</span>, <i>Odyssey</i>, X, 304 ff.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>16. What has been said by the nations, he says, suffices
for the thorough knowledge of the universals to those who
have ears to hear. For not only he who has tasted this
fruit is not turned into a beast by Circe; but those also
<span class="sidenote">p. 257.</span>
who have been already brutified by use of the powers of
such fruit, he moulds again into their first and proper form
and restores them to type and recalls their (original) impress.
And the faithful man and he who is beloved by
that witch is, he says, revealed through that milk-like and
divine fruit. Likewise <i>Leviticus</i> the third book which is the
smell or inspiration.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> For this book is of sacrifices and
oblations. For where there is a sacrifice there comes a
certain savour of fragrance from it through the incense,
of which fragrance the sense of smell (ought to be
a test).<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> <i>Numbers</i>, the fourth book he calls taste&nbsp;...<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
where speech operates. But <i>Deuteronomy</i>, he says, is
written with reference to the sense of touch of the child in
course of formation. For as the touch, touching the things
perceived by the other senses, sums up and confirms them,
teaching us whether (anything) be hard or hot or cold,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> so
the fifth book of the Law is the summary of the four books
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
written before it. All the unbegotten things, then, he says,
are in potentiality not in activity, like the grammatical or
<span class="sidenote">p. 258.</span>
geometrical art. If then one should chance upon the
fitting word and doctrine, and the bitter should be changed
into sweet, that is, the spears into reaping-hooks and the
swords into ploughshares,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> (the child) will not be chaff and
sticks for producing fire, but a perfect fruit made in semblance
(of), as I have said (and) equal and like to, the Unbegotten
and Boundless Power. But should he remain only a tree
and should not make a perfect fruit fashioned in complete
resemblance, he will be removed. For the axe is near, he
says, to the roots of the tree. Every tree, he says, which
maketh not fair fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>17. There is then, according to Simon, that blessed and
incorruptible thing hidden in everything, potentially not
actively, which is He who Stood, Stands and will Stand. It
stood above in the Unbegotten Power, it stands below amid
the rush of the waters having been begotten in likeness, and
it will stand on high beside the blessed Unbegotten Power
if it be made in (his) perfect semblance. For there are,
he says, three who have stood, and unless there are
<span class="sidenote">p. 259.</span>
three Aeons who have stood, then the Unbegotten One who
according to them is borne over the water, who by resemblance
has been fashioned again perfect (and) heavenly,
who in one thought alone<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> is more lacking than the
Unbegotten Power, is not in its proper place.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This is
what they say: “I and thou, thou one before me, I after
thee, am I.” This, he says, is one power, divided above,
below, begetting itself, increasing itself, seeking itself,
finding itself, being its own mother, its own father, its own
sister, its own spouse, its own daughter, its own son, a
mother-father,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> being one root of the universals.</p>

<p>And that, he says, the beginning of the generation of
things begotten is from fire, he understands in some such
fashion as this: In all things whatever which have birth,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the beginning of the desire of generation comes from fire.
As, for instance, the desire for mutable generation<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> is called
“being inflamed” [with love]. But the fire from being
one, turns into two. For in the man, he says, the blood
which is hot and yellow as fire is depicted, turns into seed;
but in the woman the selfsame blood (turns) into milk.
<span class="sidenote">p. 260.</span>
And from the turning in the male comes generation and
from that in the female the nourishment of that which is
generated.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This, he says, is the flaming sword turning
about to guard the path to the Tree of Life. For the blood
is turned to seed and milk and the same power becomes
father and mother of those which are born and the increase
of those which are nourished, itself lacking nothing and
being sufficient unto itself. But the Tree of Life is
guarded he says, through the turning of the flaming sword,
as we have said, which (sword) is the Seventh Power which
is from itself, which contains all things (and) which lies
stored up in the six powers. For if the flaming sword
did not turn about, that fair tree would perish and be
destroyed. But if the Logos which is lying stored up
potentially therein, is turned into seed and milk, being lord
of its proper place wherein is begotten a Logos of souls,&mdash;then
from the smallest spark it will become great and
increase in every sense and will be a boundless power
unchangeable in the aeon which changes not until it is
in the Boundless Aeon.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>18. By this argument, then, Simon avowedly became a
god to those of no understanding, like that Apsethus the
<span class="sidenote">p. 261.</span>
Libyan, being (said to be) begotten and subject to suffering
when he existed potentially, but (becoming) impassible
(from passible, and unbegotten)<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> from begotten when he
was made in perfect semblance and becoming perfect came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
forth from the first two powers, that is Heaven and Earth.
For Simon speaks explicitly of this in the <i>Announcement</i>,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Unto you I say what I say, and I write what I write.
The writing is this. There are two stems<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of all the Aeons,
having neither beginning nor end, from one root, which is
Power-Silence<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> unseen and incomprehensible. One of
them appears on high, who is a great power, the mind of
the universals, who orders all things and (is) a male. And
the other below is a great Thought, a female giving birth to
all things. These, then, being set over against each other<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
form a pair and show forth the middle space, an incomprehensible
air having neither beginning nor end. In this
(space) is a Father who upholds all things and nourishes
those which have a beginning and end. This is He who
Stood, Stands, and will Stand, being a masculo-feminine
power after the likeness of the pre-existing Boundless
Power<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> which has neither beginning nor end but exists in
oneness. For the thought which came forth from the
(power) in oneness was two. And that was one. For he
<span class="sidenote">p. 262.</span>
when he contained her within himself was alone, nor was
he indeed first although he existed beforehand, but having
himself appeared from himself, a second came into being.
But he was not called Father until she named him Father.
Just as then he, drawing himself forth from himself, manifested
to himself his own thought, so also the thought
having appeared did not create him; but beholding him,
hid the Father&mdash;that is Power&mdash;within herself;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and there is
a masculo-feminine Power-and-Thought when they are set
over against each other. For Power does not differ at all
from thought, they being one. From the things on high
is discovered Power; from those below Thought. Thus
then it is that that which appeared from them being one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is found to be two, a masculo-feminine having the female
within it. This is Mind in Thought for they being one
when undivided from one another are yet found to be
two.”</p>

<p>19. Simon then having discovered (all) this, fraudulently
interprets as he wishes not only the (words) of Moses, but
<span class="sidenote">p. 263.</span>
also those of the poets. For he turns into allegory the
Wooden Horse and Helen with the Torch and other things,
altering which to the affairs of himself and his Epinoia, he
leads astray many. And he says that she is that sheep
which was lost, who ever dwelling in many women<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> troubles
the powers in the cosmos by her transcendent beauty.
Wherefore also the Trojan War occurred on account of her.
For Epinoia herself dwelt in Helen at that time, and
all the authorities suing for her (favours), faction and war
arose among the nations in which she appeared. Wherefore
indeed Stesichorus having railed at her in his verses
had his eyes blinded, but having repented and written the
Palinode, was restored to sight.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> She, being changed from
one body to another by the angels and authorities below
<span class="sidenote">p. 264.</span>
who made the world, came at last to stand in a brothel<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in
Tyre, a city of Phœnicia, coming to which (Simon) found
her. For at her first enquiry, he said he had come to her
aid, that he might free her from her bonds, and when he
had redeemed her she went about with him pretending that
she was the lost sheep, and he saying that he was the Power
above all things. But the rogue having fallen in love with
the hussy, the so-called Helen, and having bought her
enjoyed her, and being ashamed (before) his disciples made
up this story. But they who became (in time) the imitators
of the error and of Simon Magus do like things, pretending
that they ought to have (promiscuous) intercourse like
beasts, saying: “All earth is earth and it matters not where
one sows, so long as one sows.” And they also bless this
intercourse saying that the same is perfect love and the
“Holy of Holies” and that “ye shall sanctify one another.”
For they say that they are not overcome by what any one
else would call evil, for that they have been redeemed.
And that Simon having redeemed Helen has in like manner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 265.</span>
brought salvation to men through his own discernment.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
For since the angels misgoverned the world through love of
rule, he says that he came to set it straight, having changed
his shape and making himself like the rulers<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and
authorities and angels, and that he appeared as a man,
though he was not a man and seemed to suffer in Judæa,
though he did not suffer.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> But he appeared to the Jews as
Son, in Samaria as Father, and among the other nations as
Holy Spirit. And that he submitted to be called by whatever
name men wished to call him. And that the Prophets
were inspired by the world-making angels to utter their
prophecies. Wherefore they who have believed on Simon
and Helen do not heed them,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and to this day do what
they will as being free. For they claim that they have been
saved by his grace. For no one is liable to judgment if he
does anything evil; for evil exists not by nature, but by
<span class="sidenote">p. 266.</span>
law. For he says it is the angels who made the world who
made the Law whatever they wished, thinking to enslave
those who hearkened to them. And again they say that
(there will be) a dissolution of the world for the redemption
of their own men.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>20. Therefore the disciples of this (man) practise magic
arts and incantations, and send out love-philtres and
charms and the demons called dream-bringers for the
troubling of whom they will. But they also do reverence to
the so-called Paredri.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And they have an image of Simon
in the form of Zeus, and (another) of Helen in the form
of Athena, and they bow down to them calling the one
“Lord” and the other “Lady.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But if any one among
them seeing these images should call them by the name
of Simon or Helen, he is cast out as being ignorant of their
mysteries. This Simon when he had led astray many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
in Samaria by magic arts was refuted by the Apostles, and
<span class="sidenote">p. 267.</span>
having been laid under a curse as it is written in the <i>Acts</i>,
afterwards in desperation designed these things<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> until
having come to Rome, he withstood the Apostles. Whom
Peter opposed when he was deceiving many by sorceries.
He at length coming into t......te,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> taught sitting
under a plane-tree. And finally his refutation being very
near<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> through effluxion of time, he said that if buried alive
he would rise again the third day. And having given orders
that a grave should be dug by his disciples, he bade them
bury him. And they having done what he commanded, he
remains there to this day; for he was not the Christ. This
then is Simon’s story, taking hints from which Valentinus
calls (the same things) by other names. For Nous and
Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia are
Simon’s six roots, Nous-Epinoia, Phone-Onoma, Logismos-Enthymesis.
But since we have sufficiently set forth Simon’s
fable making, let us see what Valentinus says.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>


<h3 id="VI_2">2. <i>Concerning Valentinus.</i></h3>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 268.</span>
21. The heresy of Valentinus,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> then, exists, having a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Pythagorean and Platonic foundation. For Plato in the
<i>Timæus</i> modelled himself entirely on Pythagoras, as is seen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
also by his “Pythagorean stranger” being Timæus himself.
Wherefore it seems fitting that we should begin by recalling
to mind a few (points) of the theory of Pythagoras and
Plato, and should then describe the (teaching) of Valentinus.
For if the opinions of Pythagoras and Plato are also included
in the (books) painfully written by us earlier, yet I shall not
be unreasonable in recalling<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in epitome their most leading
tenets<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in order that by their closer comparison and likeness
of composition, the doctrines of Valentinus may be more
intelligible. For as (the Pythagoreans and Platonists) took
their opinions of old from the Egyptians and taught them
anew to the Greeks, so (Valentinus) while fraudulently
attempting to establish his own teaching by them, carved
<span class="sidenote">p. 269.</span>
their system into names and numbers, calling them [by
names] and defining them by measures of his own. Whence
he has constructed a heresy Greek indeed, but not referable
to Christ.</p>

<p>22. The wisdom of the Egyptians is, then, the beginning
of Plato’s theory in the <i>Timæus</i>. For from this, Solon<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
taught the Greeks the whole position regarding the birth
and destruction of the cosmos by means of a certain prophetic
statement, as Plato says, the Greeks being then
children and knowing no older theologic learning. In
order then that we may follow closely the words which
Valentinus let fall, I will now set out as preface what it was
that Pythagoras of Samos taught as philosophy after that
silence praised by the Greeks. And then [I will point out]
those things which Valentinus takes from Pythagoras and
Plato and with solemn words attributes to Christ, and
before Christ to the Father of the universals and to that
Sige who is given as a spouse to the Father.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
23. Now Pythagoras declared that the unbegotten monad
was the principle of the universals<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and the parent of the
dyad and of all the other numbers. And he says that the
<span class="sidenote">p. 270.</span>
monad is the father of the dyad and the dyad the mother
of all engendered things (and) a bearer of things begotten.
And Zaratas,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> also, the teacher of Pythagoras, calls the one
father, but the two, mother. For the dyad has come into
being from a monad according to Pythagoras, and the
monad is masculine and first, but the dyad female and
second. From the dyad, again, as Pythagoras says, (come)
the triad and the other numbers one after the other up to
10. For Pythagoras knew that this 10 is the only perfect
number.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> For (he saw that) the 11 and 12 were an addition
to and re-equipment of the decad, and not the generation
of some other number. All solid bodies beget what is
given to them from the bodiless.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> For, he says, the Point
which is indivisible is at once a point and a beginning of
the bodies and the bodiless together. And, he says, from
the point comes a line, and a superficies extended in
depth makes, he says, a solid figure. Whence the Pythagoreans
have a certain oath as to the harmony of the four
elements. And they make oath thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="indent0"><span class="sidenote">p. 271.</span><span class="verse">“Yea by the Tetractys handed down to our head</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A source of eternal nature containing within itself roots.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">For the beginning of natural and solid bodies is the
Tetractys as the monad is of the intelligible ones.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But
that the Tetractys gives birth to the perfect number as
among the intelligibles the (monad) does to the 10, they
teach thus. If one beginning to count, says 1, and adds 2,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and then 3 in like manner, these will make 6. (Add) yet
another (<i>i. e.</i>) 4 and there in the same way will be the total
10. For the 1, 2, 3 and 4 become 10, the perfect number.
Thus, he says, the Tetractys will in all things imitate the
intelligible monad having been thus able to bring forth a
perfect number.</p>

<p>24. There are, therefore, according to Pythagoras, two
worlds, one intelligible which has the monad as its beginning,
but the other the perceptible. This last is the
Tetractys containing Iota,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the one tittle, a perfect number.
<span class="sidenote">p. 272.</span>
Thus the Iota, the one tittle, is received by the Pythagoreans
as the first and chiefest, and as the substance of
the Intelligible both intelligibly and perceptibly. Belonging
to which are the nine bodiless accidents which cannot
exist apart from substance, (viz.) Quantity, Quality, Wherefore,
Where, and When, and also Being, Having, Doing
and Suffering.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> There are therefore nine accidents to
substance reckoned in with which they comprise<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> the
perfect number, the 10. Wherefore the universe being
divided, as we have said, into an intelligible and a perceptible
world, we have also reason from the intelligible in
order that by it we may behold the substance of the intelligible,
the bodiless and the divine. But we have, he says,
five senses, smell, sight, hearing, taste and touch. By these
we arrive at a knowledge of perceptible things, and so, he
says, the perceptible world is separated from the intelligible;
and that we have an organ of knowledge for each of them,
we learn from this. None of the intelligibles, he says, can
become known to us through sense: for, he says, eye has
not seen that, nor ear heard, nor has it become known, he
says, by any other of the senses whatever. Nor again by
reason can one come to a knowledge of the perceptible;
<span class="sidenote">p. 273.</span>
but one must see that a thing is white, and taste that it is
sweet, and know by hearing that it is just or unjust; and if
any smell is fragrant or nauseous, that is the work of the
sense of smell and not of the reason. And it is the same
with the things relating to touch. For that a thing is hard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
or soft or hot or cold cannot be known through the hearing,
but the test of these things is the touch. This being
granted, the setting in order of the things that have been
and are is seen to come about arithmetically. For, just as
we, beginning by addition of monads (or dyads) or triads
and of the other numbers strung together, make one very
large compound number, and on the other hand work by
subtracting from the total strung together and by analysing
by a fresh calculation what has been brought together
arithmetically;&mdash;so, he says, the cosmos is bound together
by a certain arithmetical and musical bond, and by its
tightening and slackening, its addition and subtraction, is
ever and everywhere preserved uncorrupted.</p>

<p>25. For instance in some such fashion as this also do
the Pythagoreans describe the duration of the world:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="indent0"><span class="sidenote">p. 274.</span><span class="verse">“For it was before and will be. Never I ween</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will the unquenchable aeon be devoid of these two.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What are these (two)? Strife and Love.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But their love
makes the cosmos incorruptible and eternal, as they think.
For substance and the cosmos are one. But strife rends
asunder and diversifies, and tries by every means to make
the world divide. Just as one cuts arithmetically the myriad
into thousands and hundreds and tens and drachmas, and
obols, and quarters by dividing it into small parts, so Strife
cuts the substance of the cosmos into animals, plants,
metals and such like things. And Strife is according to
them, the Demiurge<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of the generation of all things coming
to pass, and Love governs and provides for the universe, so
that it abides. And having collected into one the scattered
and rent (things) of the universe and leading them forth
from life, it joins and adds them to the universe so that it
may abide and be one. Never therefore will Strife cease
from dividing the cosmos, nor Love from attaching together
<span class="sidenote">p. 275.</span>
the separated things of the cosmos. Something like this it
seems is the “distribution”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> according to Pythagoras. But
Pythagoras says that the stars are fragments<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of the sun and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that the souls of animals are borne (to us) from the stars.
And that the same (souls) are mortal when they are in the
body being buried as it were in a tomb; but that they will
rise again and become immortal when we are separated from
our bodies. Whence Plato being asked by some one what
Philosophy is, said: “It is a separation of soul from body.”</p>

<p>26. Pythagoras, then, becoming a learner of these
opinions, declared some of them by means of enigmas and
such like phrases, (such as:) “If you are away from home,
turn not back. Otherwise, the Furies the helpers of justice
will punish you.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> (For) he calls your home the body and
<span class="sidenote">p. 276.</span>
the passions the Furies. If then, he says, you are away
from home, that is: if you have come forth from the body,
do not seek after it; but if you return to it, the passions
will again shut you up in a body. For they think there is
a change of bodies (μετενσωμάτωσις); as also Empedocles,
when Pythagorizing, says. For the pleasure-loving souls,
as Plato says,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> if they do not philosophize when in man’s
estate, must pass through the bodies of all animals and
plants and again return to a human body. But if (such a
one) does philosophize,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> he will in the same way go on high
thrice to his kindred star; but if he does not philosophize
will return again to the same things. Thus he tells us that
the soul is at once mortal if it be ruled by the Furies, that
is, by the Passions, and immortal if it flees from them.</p>

<p>27. But seeing that we have picked out for narration the
things darkly uttered to his disciples under the veil of symbols,
it seems fitting to recall other sayings (of his), because
the heresiarchs attempt to deal in symbols in the same way;
and these not their own, but using the words of Pythagoras.
<span class="sidenote">p. 277.</span>
Now Pythagoras teaches his disciples saying “Bind up the
bed-sack,” since they who are setting out on a journey make
their clothing into a bundle, so as to be ready for the road.
Thus he wishes his disciples to be ready, as if at any
moment death might come upon them, so that they may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
not be caught lacking anything. Wherefore he is obliged
to enjoin the Pythagorean every morning to bind up the
bed-sack, that is to prepare for death. “Do not stir the
fire with a sword,” meaning do not provoke angry men; for
he likens an angry man to a fire and speech to a sword.
“Do not tread on sweepings,” that is, do not look down
upon trifles. “Do not grow a palm in a house,” that is,
do not make a cause of strife in it. For the palm is a
symbol of fighting and strife. “Eat not from a stool”
(that is), practise no ignoble art, that you may not be a
slave to the corruptible body, but make your livelihood
by lectures. For it is possible at once to nourish the body
<span class="sidenote">p. 278.</span>
and to improve the soul. “From a whole loaf bite off
nought,” (that is) diminish not that which belongs to you,
but live on the income and keep the capital like a whole
loaf. “Eat not beans” (that is) Take not the rule of a
city. For by beans the rulers<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> were then elected.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>28. These and such like things, then, the Pythagoreans say,
imitating whom the heretics think they declare great things to
certain men. The Pythagorean doctrine says that the Great
Geometrician and Reckoner<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the Sun is the Demiurge of
all things that are, and is fixed in the whole cosmos like the
soul in bodies, as says Plato. For the Sun like the soul is
fire, but the earth a body. But if fire were absent, nothing
could be seen, nor could there be any solid perceptible to
the touch; for there is no solid without earth. Whence
God having put air in the midst, fashioned the body of the
universe from fire and earth.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But the Sun reckons and
measures the cosmos in some such fashion as this. The
cosmos is that perceptible one of which we are now speaking.
But (the Sun) divides it as an arithmetician and
geometrician into twelve parts. And the names of these
<span class="sidenote">p. 279.</span>
parts are:&mdash;Ram, Bull, Twins, Crab, Lion, Virgin, Scales,
Scorpion, Archer, He-goat, Waterbearer and Fishes.
Again, he divides each of the twelve parts into thirty which
are the thirty days of the month. And again he divides each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
of the thirty parts into sixty minutes and (each) minute into
yet smaller and smaller parts. And thus ever creating
without ceasing, but gathering together from these divided
parts and making a cycle, and again dissolving it and
separating that which has been put together, he perfects
the great deathless cosmos.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>29. Something like this, as I have just summarily said, is
the teaching framed by Pythagoras and Plato. From which
and not from the Gospels, Valentinus has drawn his own
heresy, as we shall show, and should therefore be reckoned
a Pythagorean and a Platonist, but not as a Christian.
Accordingly he and Heracleon and Ptolemy and all their
school, the disciples of Pythagoras and Plato copying their
teachers, have framed an arithmetical doctrine of their own.
<span class="sidenote">p. 280.</span>
For indeed an unbegotten, incorruptible, incomprehensible
fruitful Monad is to them the beginning of all and the cause
of the birth of all things that are. Yet a certain wide
difference is found among them. For some of them, that
they may keep wholly pure the Pythagorean teaching of
Valentinus, consider the Father to be unfeminine,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> spouseless,
and alone: whereas the others, thinking it absolutely
impossible that there could be a birth of all things that have
been born from any single male, are compelled to reckon
Sige<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> as a spouse to the Father of the universals in order
that he may become a father. But as to whether Sige is a
spouse or not, let them fight it out with each other.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We,
keeping steadfast at present to the Pythagorean (doctrine
of) the beginning and remembering what others teach, say
that He is one, without spouse, without female, in need of
nought. In a word (Valentinus) says at the beginning nothing
was begotten, but the Father was alone, unbegotten,
having neither place, nor time, nor counsellor, nor any
other thing that by any figure of speech could be understood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
as essence.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> But He was alone and solitary, as they say,
and resting alone within Himself. And when He was filled
with fruit, He saw fit to beget and bring forth the most
<span class="sidenote">p. 281.</span>
beautiful and perfect thing He had within Himself. For He
did not love to be alone.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> For He, Valentinus says, was all
Love and love is not love unless there be something to be
loved. Then the Father himself projected and engendered,
as He was alone, Mind and Truth,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that is a dyad, which
became the lady and beginning and mother of all the aeons
reckoned by them as being within the Pleroma. But Nous
and Aletheia having been projected by the Father, a fruitful
(projection) from the fruitful, imitating the Father projected
also the Word and Life;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and Logos and Zoe projected Man
and the Church.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> But Nous and Aletheia when they saw
that their own special progeny had become fruitful, gave
thanks to the Father of the universals and offered to him a
perfect number, ten Aeons. For than this, he says, Nous
and Aletheia could offer to the Father no more perfect
number. For the Father being perfect ought to be glorified
with a perfect number. And the ten is perfect because as
the first of things that came into being by addition, it is
complete.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> But the Father is more perfect because he
<span class="sidenote">p. 282.</span>
alone is unbegotten, and by the first single syzygy of Nous
and Aletheia supplied the projection of all the roots of the
things that are.</p>

<p>30. Then when Logos and Zoe saw that Nous and
Aletheia had glorified the Father of the universals in a
perfect number, Logos himself with Zoe<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> also wished to
glorify his own father and mother, Nous and Aletheia. But
since Nous and Aletheia were begotten and did not possess
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the complete paternal unbegotten nature,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Logos and Zoe
did not glorify their father Nous with a perfect number, but
with an imperfect one: for Logos and Zoe offer twelve
Aeons to Nous and Aletheia. For the first roots of the Aeons
according to Valentinus were Nous and Aletheia, Logos and
Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. But there are twelve Aeons
two of which are the children of Nous and Aletheia and
ten those of Logos and Zoe, in all twenty-eight. And these
are the names by which they call (the ten): Profound and
Mixture, Who-grows-not-old and Oneness, Self-grown and
<span class="sidenote">p. 283.</span>
Pleasure, Unmoved and Blending, Unique and Blessedness.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Of these ten Aeons some say that they are by Nous and
Aletheia and others by Logos and Zoe; and there are twelve
others which some say are by Anthropos and Ecclesia and
others by Logos and Zoe. To whom they give these names:
Paraclete and Faith, Fatherly and Hope, Motherly and Love,
Ever-thinking and Union, Of the Church and Blessed,
Beloved and Wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Of the twelve the twelfth and
youngest of all the twenty-four Aeons who was a female and
called Sophia,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> perceived the multitude and power of the
Aeons who had been begotten and shot up into the Height
of the Father. And she comprehended that all the other
begotten Aeons existed and had been brought forth in pairs,
but that the Father alone produced without a partner. She
wished to imitate the Father and gave birth by herself
and apart from her spouse, so that she might work no work
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
lacking anything more than did the work of the Father,
<span class="sidenote">p. 284.</span>
being ignorant that only the Unbegotten principle and
root and height and depth of the universals can possibly
bring forth alone. For in the Unbegotten, he says, all
things exist together; but among the begotten the female is
the projector of substance, but the male gives form to the
substance<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> which the female projects. Therefore Sophia
projected only that which she could, a substance shapeless
and unformed.[118] And this, he says, is what Moses said:
“Now the earth was invisible and unformed.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> She, he says,
is the good or heavenly Jerusalem into which God declared
he would lead the children of Israel, saying: “I will lead
you into a good land flowing with milk and honey.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>31. Ignorance, then, having come about within the
Pleroma by Sophia, and formlessness by the offspring of
Sophia, confusion came to pass within it. For the Aeons
(feared) that what was born from them would be born
<span class="sidenote">p. 285.</span>
shapeless and imperfect, and that corruption would before
long destroy them. Then all the Aeons took refuge in
prayers to the Father that he would give rest to the sorrowing
Sophia. For she was weeping and mourning over the
Abortion<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> brought forth by her&mdash;for so they call it. Then
the Father took pity on the tears of Sophia, and hearkened
to the prayers of the Aeons and commanded a projection
to be made. For he himself did not project, but Nous and
Aletheia projected Christ and the Holy Spirit for the giving
form to and the separation of the Ectroma and the relief
and intermission of the groans of Sophia. And thirty
Aeons came into existence with Christ and the Holy Spirit.
But some of them will have it that there is a triacontad of
Aeons, but others that Sige co-exists with the Father, and
wish the Aeons to be counted in with those (two). Then,
when Christ and the Holy Spirit had been projected<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> by
Nous and Aletheia, he straightway separates from the complete
Aeons Ectroma, the shapeless and unique<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> thing
which had been brought forth by Sophia apart from her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 286.</span>
spouse, so that the perfect Aeons might not be troubled by
the sight of her shapelessness. Then, that the shapelessness
of Ectroma might no way be apparent to the perfect
Aeons, the Father again projected one Aeon (to wit) the
Cross, who having been born great from the great and perfect
Father and projected as a guard and palisade to the
Aeons, becomes the limit of the Pleroma containing within
him all the thirty Aeons together: for they were projected
before him. And he is called Horos because he separates
from the Pleroma the Void<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> without; and Metocheus<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
because he partakes also in the Hysterema; and Stauros
because he is fixed unbendingly and unchangeably, so that
nothing from the Hysterema can abide near the Aeons who
<span class="sidenote">p. 287.</span>
are within the Pleroma. And when Sophia Without had
been transformed and it was not possible for Christ and the
Holy Spirit, the projections of Nous and Aletheia, to remain
outside the Pleroma, they returned from her who had been
transformed, to Nous and Aletheia within Horos, so that
he with the other Aeons might glorify the Father.</p>

<p>32. Since then there was a certain single peace and harmony
of all the Aeons within the Pleroma, it seemed good
to them not only to have glorified the Father in pairs, but
also to glorify him by the offering to him of fitting fruits.
Therefore all the thirty Aeons were well pleased to project
one Aeon, the Common Fruit of the Pleroma, so that
he might be the (fruit) of their unity and likemindedness
and peace. And as He alone was projected by all the
Father’s Aeons, He is called by them the Common Fruit of
the Pleroma. Thus then were things within the Pleroma.
And the Common Fruit of the Pleroma was projected, (to
wit) Jesus&mdash;for that is His name&mdash;the Great High Priest.
<span class="sidenote">p. 288.</span>
But Sophia without the Pleroma seeking after Christ, who
had given her shape and the Holy Spirit, stood in great fear,
lest she might perish when separated from Him who had
given her shape and had established her. And she mourned
and was in great perplexity considering who it was that had
given her shape, who the Holy Spirit was, whence she had
gone forth, who had hindered them from coming near her,
(and) who had begrudged her that fair and blessed vision.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Brought low by these passions, she turns to beseeching
supplication of Him who had left her. Then Christ who
was within the Pleroma had compassion on her beseeching,
as had all the Aeons of the Pleroma, and they send forth
outside the Pleroma its Common Fruit to be a spouse to
Sophia Without and the corrector of the passions which she
suffered while seeking after Christ.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Then the Fruit being
outside the Pleroma and finding her amid the first four passions
(to wit) in fear and grief and perplexity and supplication,
corrected her passions, but did not think it seemly
in correcting them that they should be destroyed, since they
<span class="sidenote">p. 289.</span>
were eternal and special to Sophia, nor yet that Sophia
should be among such passions as fear and grief, supplication
and perplexity. He, therefore, being so great an Aeon
and the offspring of the whole Pleroma, made the passions
stand away from her and He made them fundamental
essences.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> And He made the fear into the essence of the
soul,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and the grief into that of matter, and the perplexity
into (that) of demons, but the conversion and entreaty and
supplication He made a path to repentance and (the) power
of the soul’s essence, which (essence) is called the Right
Hand or Demiurge from fear. This, he says, is the Scripture
saying: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
For it was the beginning of the passions of Sophia. For
she feared, then she grieved, then she was perplexed, and
<span class="sidenote">p. 290.</span>
then she took refuge in prayer and supplication. And the
essence of the soul, he says, is fiery and is called a (supercelestial)
Place and Hebdomad and Ancient of Days.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> And
whatever things they say of him, he says, the same belong
to the psychic one whom they declare to be the Demiurge
of the Cosmos; but he is fiery. And Moses also, he says,
spake, “The Lord thy God is a burning and consuming
fire.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> And truly he wishes this (text) to be thus written.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
But the power of the fire, he says, is in some sort double;
for it is an all-devouring fire (and) cannot be quenched.
And according to this, indeed, a part of the soul is mortal,
being a certain middle state; for it is a Hebdomad and
Laying to Rest. For below (the soul) is of the Ogdoad
where is Sophia, a day which has been given shape, and the
Common Fruit of the Pleroma; but above it is of Matter
wherein is the Demiurge.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> If it makes itself completely
like those who are on high in the Ogdoad, it becomes immortal
and comes to the Ogdoad, which is, he says, the
heavenly Jerusalem; but if it makes itself completely like
matter, that is to the material passions, it is corruptible and
is destroyed.</p>

<p>33. As therefore the first and greatest power of the
<span class="sidenote">p. 291.</span>
psychic essence becomes an image [of the only-begotten
Son, so the power of the material essence] is the devil, the
ruler of this world, and (that) of the essence of demons,
which is from perplexity, is Beelzebud.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> But it is Sophia
on high who works from the Ogdoad up to the Hebdomad.
They say that the Demiurge knows absolutely nothing, but
is according to them mindless and foolish and knows not
what he does or works. And for him who knows not what he
makes, Sophia creates all things and strengthens them. And
when she had wrought it, he thought that he had by himself
accomplished the creation of the cosmos; wherefore he
began to say: “I am God, and beside me there is none other.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="noin">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and Sophia by whom the psychic and material creation
is now framed. And Sophia is called Spirit, but the
<span class="sidenote">p. 292.</span>
Demiurge Soul, and the Devil the ruler of the world, and
Beelzebud that of the demons. This is what they say, and
beside this, they make their whole teaching arithmetical;
[and] as is said above, they (imagine) that (the) thirty
Aeons within the Pleroma again projected other Aeons by
analogy with themselves, so that the Pleroma may be
summed up in a perfect number. For, as it has been made
clear that the Pythagoreans divide (the circle) into 12
and 30 and 60 (parts) and that these have also minutes
of minutes, thus also do (the Valentinians) subdivide
the things within the Pleroma. But subdivided also are
the things in the Ogdoad, and there rules<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> (there) Sophia who
is according to them the Mother of All Living, and the
Logos, the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma, (and) there are
(there) supercelestial angels, citizens of the Jerusalem on
<span class="sidenote">p. 293.</span>
high, which is in heaven. For this Jerusalem is Sophia.
Without and her bridegroom the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma.
(But) the Demiurge also projected souls; for he is the
essence of souls. This is according to them Abraham and
these are the children of Abraham. Then, from the
material and devilish essence the Demiurge has made the
bodies of the souls. This is the saying: “And God made
man, taking dust from the earth, and breathed into his face
a breath of life, and man became a living soul.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This is,
according to them, the inward psychic man who dwells in
the material body which is material, corruptible, and formed
entirely of devilish essence. But this material man is
(according to them) like unto an inn, or the dwelling-place,
sometimes of the soul alone, sometimes of the soul and
demons, and sometimes of the soul and logoi, who are logoi
sown from above in this world by the Joint Fruit of the
Pleroma, and by Sophia, and who dwell in the earthly body
with the soul when there are no demons dwelling with it.
<span class="sidenote">p. 294.</span>
This, he says, is what was written in Scripture: “For this
cause I bow my knees to the God and Father and Lord of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that God would grant you that Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
should dwell in the inner man, that is the psychical not
the somatic, that you be strengthened to comprehend what
is the depth” which is the Father of the universals “and
what is the breadth,”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> which is Stauros the Limit of the
Pleroma, “or what the length,” which is the Pleroma of the
Aeons. Wherefore, he says, the psychic man does not receive
the things of God’s spirit; for they are foolishness unto him.
But foolishness, he says, is the power of the Demiurge, for
he was senseless and mindless and thought that he fashioned
the cosmos, being ignorant that Sophia, the Mother, the
Ogdoad, wrought all things with regard to the creation of the
world for him who knew it not.</p>

<p>35. All the prophets and the Law, then, spake from the
(inspiration of the) Demiurge, a foolish god,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> he says, being
themselves foolish and knowing nothing. Wherefore, he
says, the Saviour declared: “All who came before me are
thieves and robbers.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The Apostle also: “The mystery
which was not known to the first generations.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> For none
<span class="sidenote">p. 295.</span>
of the prophets, he says, declared anything concerning the
things of whereof we speak; for all (of them) were ignored
in what was said by the Demiurge alone.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> When, therefore,
creation was brought to completion,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and the revelation of
the sons of God, that is of the Demiurge, at length became
necessary, which had before been concealed, he says, the
psychic man was veiled and had a veil upon his heart.
Then when it was time that the veil should be taken away,
and that these mysteries should be seen, Jesus was born
through Mary the Virgin<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> according to the saying: “(The)
Holy Spirit shall come upon thee”&mdash;the Spirit is Sophia&mdash;“and
a power of the Highest shall overshadow thee”&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Highest is the Demiurge. “Wherefore that which is born
from thee shall be called holy.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> For He was born not
from the Highest alone, as those created after the fashion
of Adam were created from the Highest, that is from the
Demiurge. But Jesus was the new man (born) from the
Holy Spirit (and the Highest),<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> that is from Sophia and
the Demiurge, so that the Demiurge supplied the mould
and constitution of His body, but the Holy Spirit supplied
<span class="sidenote">p. 296.</span>
His substance,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and thus the Heavenly Logos came into
being, having been begotten from the Ogdoad through
Mary. Concerning this there is a great enquiry among
them and a source of schisms and variance. And hence
their school<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> has become divided and one part is called by
them the Anatolic and the other the Italiote. Those from
Italy, whereof are Heracleon and Ptolemy, say that the
body of Jesus was born psychic, and therefore the Spirit
descended as a dove at the Baptism, that is the Word
which is of the mother Sophia on high and cried aloud
to the psychic man<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and raised him from the dead. This,
he says, is the saying: “He who raised Christ from the
dead, shall quicken your mortal bodies (and your psychic).”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
For earth, he says, has come under a curse. “For Earth,”
he says, “thou art, and to earth thou shalt return.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
those from the East, whereof are Axionicus and Bardesanes,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 297.</span>
say that the body of the Saviour was spiritual. For
(the) Holy Spirit came upon Mary, that is Sophia and the
Power of the Highest is the demiurgic art,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> so that that
which was given by the Spirit to Mary might be moulded
(into form).</p>

<p>36. These things then let these men enquire after in
their own way, and if they should happen to do so in any
other, so let it be. But (Valentinus) also says that as the
false steps among the Aeons had been put straight<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and
also those in the Ogdoad or Sophia Without, so also were
those in the Hebdomad. For the Demiurge was taught by
Sophia that he is not the only God as he thought, and that
beside him there is none other; but he knew better after
being taught by Sophia. For he was schooled by her and
was initiated and taught the great mystery of the Father
and the Aeons and told it to none. This, he says, is what
he spake to Moses: “I am the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, and my name I have
not announced to them,”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> that is to say: “I have not told
the mystery nor have I explained who is God, but I have
kept to myself the mystery which I have heard from
Sophia.” It was necessary, then, that the things on high
having been put straight, in the same sequence,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> correction
<span class="sidenote">p. 298.</span>
should come to those here. For this cause was Jesus the
Saviour born through Mary, that He might put straight
things here, as the Christ, who on high was projected by
Nous and Aletheia, put straight the passions of Sophia
Without, that is, of the Ectroma. And again the Saviour
who was born through Mary came to set straight the
passions of the soul. There are, then, according to them
three Christs, the one projected by Nous and Aletheia along
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
with the Holy Spirit; and the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma the
equal yoke-fellow<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> of Sophia Without who is called and is
herself a Holy Spirit (but) inferior to the first; and third,
He who was born through Mary for the restoration<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> of this
creation of ours.</p>

<p>37. I consider I have now by means of many (explanations)
sufficiently sketched the heresy of Valentinus, it
being a Pythagorean one; and it seems to me that the
refutation of these doctrines by exposition should stop.
Plato, moreover, when setting forth mysteries concerning
the universe writes to Dionysius in some such way as this:<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>“I must speak to you in enigmas, so that if the tablet
<span class="sidenote">p. 299.</span>
should suffer in any of its leaves on sea or land, whoso
reads may not understand.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> For things are thus. As
regards the king of all, all things are his, and all are for
his sake, and he is the cause of all that is fair. A second
(cause exists) concerning secondary things and a third concerning
those things which come third.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But respecting
the king himself there is nothing of this kind of which I
have spoken. But after this the soul seeks to learn of
what quality these are, since it looks towards the things
which are germane to itself, of which it has nought sufficiently.
This is, O son of Dionysius and Doris, your
question as to what is the cause of all evils. But it is
rather that anxiety about this is inborn, and if one does
not remove it, one will never hit upon the truth.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> But
what is wonderful about it, hear. For there are men who
have heard these things, able to learn and able to remember,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
and who have yet grown old while straining to form
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
a complete judgment. They say that what (once) appeared
believable is now unbelievable, and that what was then
unbelievable was then the opposite. Looking therefore to
<span class="sidenote">p. 300.</span>
this, beware, lest you repent what has unworthily fallen
from you. Wherefore I have written none of these things,
nor is there anything (upon them) signed Plato, nor will
there ever be. But the sayings now attributed to Socrates
were (said by him)<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> when he was young and fair.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>(Now) Valentinus having chanced upon these (lines) conceived
the king of all, of whom Plato spoke, to be Father
and Bythos and the primal source of all the Aeons.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And
when Plato spoke of the second (cause) concerning secondary
things, Valentinus assumed that the secondary things
were all the Aeons being within the limit of the Pleroma
and the third (cause) concerning the third things, he
assumed to be the whole arrangement without the limit
and (outside) the Pleroma. And this Valentinus made
plain in the fewest words in a psalm, beginning from below
and not as Plato did from above, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
from Bythos, which is the whole emanation of Aeons
coming into being from the Father. The opinions of
Valentinus have therefore been sufficiently told.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It remains
to tell of the teachings of those who have been obedient
to his school, another having different teaching.</p>

38. A certain Secundus, who was born at the same time
as Ptolemy, says that there exist a right hand and a left
hand tetrad like light and darkness. And he says that the
Power which fell away and is lacking<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> came into being not
from the thirty Aeons, but from their fruits. But there
is a certain Epiphanes, a teacher of theirs, who says:
“The First Principle<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> was incomprehensible, ineffable and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
unnameable” which he calls Solitude<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and that a Power of
this co-exists with it which he names Oneness.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The same
Monotes and Henotes preceded [but] did not send forth<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
an unbegotten and invisible principle over all which he
calls<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> a Monad. “With this Power co-exists a power of
the same essence with itself, which same power I also name
the One.” These four Powers themselves sent forth the
remaining projections of the Aeons. But others of them
<span class="sidenote">p. 303.</span>
again have called the first and primordial Ogdoad by these
names: first, “Before the Beginning,” then “Inconceivable,”
third “Ineffable” and the fourth, “Invisible;”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and (they
say) that from the first Proarche was projected in the first
and fifth place Beginning; from Anennoetos, in the second
and sixth (place) Unrevealed, from Arrheton in the third
and seventh place, Unnameable and from Aoratos, Unbegotten.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
(This is the) Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. And
they will have these powers to have existed before Bythos
and Sige. But yet others understand differently about
Bythos himself, some saying that he is spouseless and neither
male nor female, and others that Sige exists beside him as
his female and that this is the first syzygy.</p>

39. But the adherents of Ptolemy say that he [Bythos]
has two partners whom they call also (his) predispositions<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
(<i>i. e.</i>) Thought and Will. For he first had it in mind to
project something, and then he willed (to do so). Wherefore
from these two diatheses and powers, that is, from
Ennoia and Thelesis as it were blending with one another,
the projection of Monogenes and Aletheia as a pair came
to pass. The which types and images of the two diatheses
of the Father came forth visible from the invisible, Nous
from Thelema<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and Aletheia from Ennoia. Therefore also
the male image was born from the later-begotten Thelema,
but the female from the unbegotten Ennoia, because
Thelema came into being like a power from Ennoia. For
Ennoia has ever in mind projection, but she is not able by
herself to project what she has in mind. But when the
power of Thelema [came into being later],<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> then she
projected what she had in mind.</p>

<p>40. And a certain other teacher of theirs, Marcus, an
<span class="sidenote">p. 305.</span>
expert in magic, depending now on trickery and now on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
demons, leads astray many. For he says that there is in
him the greatest power from the invisible and unnameable
places. And often he takes a cup, as if consecrating it,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
and prolonging the words of consecration, causes the
mixture to appear purple and sometimes red, so as to make
his dupes think that a certain grace has come down, and
has given a blood-like power<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to the draught. But the
rogue, though he formerly escaped the notice of many,
will, now that he has been refuted,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> have to stop. For he
used secretly to insert a certain drug having the power of
giving such a colour to the mixture, and then to wait while
uttering much gibberish, until it dissolved by absorbing
moisture and, mixing with the draught, coloured it. And
the drugs which can thus give colour we have before
described in our book against the Magicians,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and have set
forth how leading many astray, they utterly ruin them.
Which (last), if they care to consider more carefully what
has been said above, will know the fraud of Marcus.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 306.</span>
41. Which (Marcus) also, mixing a cup by another hand,
(sometimes) gives it<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> to a woman to consecrate, while he
stands by her side holding a larger one empty: and when
the dupe has made the consecration, he takes (the cup)
from her, and empties it into the larger one and many times
pouring (the contents) from one cup to the other, says
these words over them: “May the Incomprehensible and
Ineffable Charis who is earlier than the universals fill thy
inner man, and make abundant in thee the knowledge<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
her, even as she scatters the mustard seed upon the good
ground!” And as he speaks some such words over it, and
(thereby) distracts the dupe and the bystanders, so that he
is considered a miracle-worker, he fills the larger cup from
the smaller so that it overflows. And we have set forth
the trick of this in the above-named book, where we have
pointed out many drugs which have the power of causing
increase when thus mixed with watery substances,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> especially
when mingled with wine: the drug compounded beforehand,
being hidden in the empty cup in such a way that this
may be exhibited as containing nothing, and being poured
backwards and forwards from one cup to the other, so as to
dissolve the drug by mixture with the water,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and so that
<span class="sidenote">p. 307.</span>
when it is inflated by air, an overflow of the water comes
about, and it increases the more it is shaken, since such is
the nature of the drug. If, however, one lays aside the cup
when filled, the mixture will before long return to its former
volume, the power of the drug being quenched by the
continued moisture. Wherefore he hurriedly gives the
bystanders to drink; and they being at the same time
scared and thirsting for it as something divine and mingled
by a god, hasten to drink.</p>

<p>42. Such like and other things, the deceiver undertakes
to do. Whence he was glorified by those he duped and
was thought sometimes to prophesy himself and sometimes
to make others do so, either effecting this by demons or
by trickery as we have said above. Further he utterly
ruined many,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and led on many of them to become his
disciples (by) teaching them to be indifferent to sin<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> as
free from danger (to them) through their belonging to the
Perfect Power and partakers of the Inconceivable Authority.
To whom also after baptism they promise another which
they call Redemption,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and thereby turn again to evil those
<span class="sidenote">p. 308.</span>
who remain with them in the hope of deliverance, (as if)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
those who had been once baptized might again meet with
acquittal. Through such jugglery,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> they seem to retain
their hearers, whom, when they consider that they have
been (duly) indoctrinated and are able to keep fast the
things entrusted to them, they then lead to this (second
baptism), not contenting themselves with this alone, but
promising them still something else, for the purpose of keeping
control over them by hope, lest they should separate
from them. For they mutter something in an inaudible
voice, laying hands on them for the receiving of Redemption
which they pretend cannot be spoken openly unless
one were highly instructed, or when the bishop should come
to speak it into the ears of one departing this life.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> And
this jugglery is practised so that they may remain the
bishop’s disciples, eagerly desirous to learn what has been
said about the last thing<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> whereby the learner would become
perfect. Of which things I have kept silence for this
cause, lest any should think I put the worst construction
on them. For this is not what we have set before us, but
rather the exposure of whence they have derived the hints<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
from which their doctrines have arisen.</p>

<p>43. For the blessed elder Irenæus having come forward
<span class="sidenote">p. 309.</span>
very openly for (their) refutation has set forth these baptisms
and redemptions saying in rounder terms what those
who traffic<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> with them do; and if some of these deny that
they have thus received them (it is because) they learn to
always deny.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Wherefore we have been careful to enquire
very sedulously and to find out minutely what they hand
down in the first baptism as they call it, and what in the
second which they call Redemption: and no unutterable
doing of theirs has escaped us. But let us abandon<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> these
things to Valentinus and his school.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Marcus, however, imitating his teacher himself also concocts
a vision, thinking thus to glorify himself. For Valentinus
claims that he himself saw a new-born infant, hearing
whom he enquired who he might be. And (the infant)
answered declaring himself to be the Logos. Thereupon
(Valentinus) having added a certain tragic myth, wishes
from this to construct the heresy which he had already
taken in hand.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> With like audacity, Marcus declares that
the Tetrad came before him in feminine shape; because,
he says, the cosmos could not bear its male form.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> And
<span class="sidenote">p. 310.</span>
she disclosed to him what she was, and the coming into
being of all things, which she had never yet revealed to
any either of gods or men (but) announced it to him alone,
saying thus:&mdash;when the First (Being) who has no father,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
the Inconceivable and Substanceless One, who is neither
male nor female, willed the ineffable to be spoken and the
invisible to take shape, He opened His mouth and a Logos
like unto Him went forth. Who, standing beside Him,
showed Him what He was, Himself having appeared in
the shape of the Invisible One. And the utterance of the
name was on this wise. He spoke the first word of the
name which was the beginning and was the syllable<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> of four
letters. And He added to it the second, and it also was
of four letters. And He spoke the third, which was of ten
letters and then the fourth, and this was of twelve. There
came to pass therefore, the pronunciation of the whole
name of thirty letters, but of four syllables. But each
of the elements has its own letters<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and its own character,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and its own pronunciation and figures and images, nor
is there any of them which perceives the form of another.
<span class="sidenote">p. 311.</span>
Nor does it see that it is an element, nor know the pronunciation
of its neighbour; but each sounds as if pronouncing
the whole, and believes itself to be naming the [universe].<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
For while each of them is a part of the universe, it thinks
its own sound names as it were the whole, and does not
cease to sound until it has arrived at the last single-tongued
letter of the last element. Then he says that the return of
the universals (to the Deity)<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> will come to pass when all
things coming together into one letter shall echo one and
the same sound. He supposes that the likeness of this
sound is the Amen<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> which we speak in unison. But (he
says) that the vowels<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> exist to give shape to the substanceless
and unbegotten Aeon, and that they are those forms
which the Lord called angels, which behold without
ceasing the Father’s face.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>44. But the names of the elements which are common
(to all) and may be spoken, he calls Aeons and Logoi and
Roots and Seeds<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and Pleromas and Fruits. And (he says)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 312.</span>
that every one of them and what is special to each is to
be comprehended as comprised in the name of Ecclesia.
Of which elements, he says, that the last letter of the last
element first sent forth<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> its own sound, the echo of which
going forth begot its own elements as being the images of
the other elements. Wherefrom, he says, both the things
here below were set in order and those which were before
them were brought into being.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> He says nevertheless that
the very letter the sound of which followed immediately
upon the echo below was taken up again by its own syllable
in order to fill full again the universe, but that the echo
remained in the things below as if cast outside it.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> But
the element itself wherefrom the letter with its pronunciation
came down below, he says, is of thirty letters, and
every one of the thirty letters contains within itself other
letters whereby the name of the letter is named. And
again others are named by other letters and yet others
by these others, so that the total comes out to infinity, if
the letters be written separately.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> You will more clearly
<span class="sidenote">p. 313.</span>
understand what has been said (if it be put) thus:&mdash;The
element Delta contains in itself five letters, the Delta, the
Epsilon, the Lambda, the Tau and the Alpha and the same
letters (are written) by other letters <a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. If then the whole
substance<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> of the Delta comes out to infinity, letters constantly
giving birth to other letters and succeeding one
another, how much greater than that one element is the
sea of letters? And if the one letter be thus infinite, behold
the depth<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> of the letters of the whole name whereof the
industry or rather the idiot labour<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> of Marcus will have
the Forefather to be composed. Wherefore, (he says) the
Father, knowing well His unconfined nature, gave to the
elements which He calls Aeons, the power for each to send
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
forth the pronunciation of his own name, whereby none is
capable of pronouncing the whole.</p>

<p>45. And [it is said that] the Tetrad having explained
these things to him, said:&mdash;“I desire now to show to thee
Aletheia<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> herself; for I have brought her down from the
dwellings on high in order that thou mayest behold her
<span class="sidenote">p. 314.</span>
unclothed and learn her beauty, and may also hear her
speak and admire her wisdom. See then the head on high
the first Alpha-Omega, and the neck Beta-Psi, the shoulders
(together with the hands) Gamma-Chi, the breast Delta-Phi,
the waist Epsilon-Upsilon, the belly Zeta-Tau, the privy
parts Eta-Sigma, the thighs Theta-Rho, the knees Iota-Pi,
the legs Kappa-Omicron, the ankles Lambda-Xi, the feet
Mu-Nu.” Such is the body of Aletheia according to Marcus,
this the form of the element, this the impress of the
letter. And he calls this element Anthropos<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and says that
it is the fountain of all speech and the principle of every
sound, and the utterance of everything ineffable, and the
mouth of the silent Sige.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> “And this is her body. But
do thou raising on high the understanding of the intelligence,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
hear the Self-Begotten and Forefather Word from
the lips of Truth.”</p>

<p>46. When (the Tetrad) had thus spoken (says Marcus),
Aletheia looking upon him and opening her mouth spake a
word. But that word was a name and the name was that
which we know and speak (to wit) Christ Jesus, having
<span class="sidenote">p. 315.</span>
spoken which, she straightway became silent. And when
Marcus expected her to say something more, the Tetrad
again coming forward said: “Holdest thou simple the word
which thou hast heard from the lips of Aletheia? Yet that
which you know and seem to have possessed of old is not
the name. For you have its sound only, and know not its
power. For Jesus is an illustrious name having six letters<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
invoked by all the Elect. But that which occurs among the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
(five)<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Aeons of the Pleroma has many parts (and) is of
another shape and of a different type, being known by
those of (His) kindred whose magnitudes<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> are ever with
Him.”</p>

<p>47. “Know ye that the twenty-four letters among you
are emanations in the likeness of the Three Powers encompassing
the universe<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and (the) number of the elements on
<span class="sidenote">p. 316.</span>
high. For suppose that the nine mute letters<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> are those
of the Father and of Aletheia, because they are mute, that
is, ineffable and unutterable; and the semi-mute which are
eight,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> those of Logos and Zoe, because they exist as it
were half-way between the mute and those which sound,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
and they receive the emanation from those above them and
the ascension of those below; and the vowels&mdash;and they
are seven<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>&mdash;are those of Anthropos and Ecclesia, since it
is the sound going forth from Anthropos which has given
form to the universals. For the echo of the sound has
clothed them with shape.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> There are then Logos and Zoe
having the 8 and Anthropos and Ecclesia the 7 and the
Father and Aletheia the 9. But since the reckoning was
deficient,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> He who was seated in the Father came down,
having been sent forth from that wherefrom he had been
separated for the rectification of the things which had been
done, so that the unity of the Pleromas which is in the
Good One might bear as fruit one power which is in all
from all. And thus the 7 recovered the power of the 8,
<span class="sidenote">p. 317.</span>
and the three places became alike in numbers, being three
ogdoads. Which three added together show forth the
number of 24.” In fact the three elements (which he says
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
exist in the syzygy of the three powers, which are 6, the
flowing-forth of which are the 24 elements) having been
quadrupled by the Word of the Ineffable Tetrad make
the same number for themselves which he says is (that)
of the Unnameable One. But they were clothed by the 6
powers in the likeness of the Invisible One, of the images
of which elements the double letters are the likeness, which
added to the 24 elements by analogy make potentially the
number 30.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>48. He says that the fruit of this reckoning and arrangement<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
appeared<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> in semblance of an image (to wit) He who
after the six days went up to the mountain<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> as one of four
<span class="sidenote">p. 318.</span>
persons and became one of six. Who came down and bore
rule in the Hebdomad, Himself becoming the illustrious<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
Ogdoad and containing within Himself the whole number
of the elements. Which the descent of the dove coming
upon Him at the baptism made plain, which (dove) is
Alpha and Omega, the number being plainly 801.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> And
because of this Moses said that man came into being on
the 6th day. But according to the economy of the Passion
on the 6th day, which is the Preparation,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> the last man appeared
for the regeneration of the First Man. Of this
economy, the beginning and the end was the 6th hour,
wherein he was nailed to the Cross. For, (he says) that
the perfect Nous, knowing that number 6 possesses the
power of creation and regeneration<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> made apparent to the
Sons of Light the regeneration which had come through
Him who appeared as Episemon. For the illustrious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
number<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> when blended with the other elements completes
the 30-lettered name.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 319.</span>
49. But He has made use as His instrument of the greatness
of the 7 numbers, in order that the Fruit of the
self-inspired (Council)<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> might be made manifest. Consider,
he says, this Episemon here present, which has taken shape
from the Illustrious One who has been, as it were, cut into
parts and remains without. Who, by His own power and
forethought, by means of His own projection which is that
of the Seven Powers, imitated the Seventh Power and gave
life to the cosmos<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and set it to be the soul of this visible
universe. He therefore uses this same work also as if it
came into being by Him independently; but the rest being
imitations of that which is inimitable minister to the Enthymesis<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
of the Mother. And the first heaven sounds the
Alpha, and that following it the Epsilon, and the 3rd the
Eta, and the 4th and middle one of the 7 the power of
the Iota, and the 5th the Omicron, and the 6th the Upsilon,
<span class="sidenote">p. 320.</span>
and the 7th the Omega. And all the heavens when locked
together into one, give forth a sound and glorify Him by
whom they were projected. And the glory of the sounding
is sent on high into the presence of the Forefather<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.
And, he says, that the echo of this glorifying being borne
to the earth becomes the Fashioner and begetter of those
upon the earth. And there is a proof of this in the case of
newly born children, whose breath immediately they come
forth from the womb, cries aloud likewise the sound of each
one of these elements. As then the Seven Powers, he says,
glorify the Word, so does the complaining soul among
infants. Wherefore, he says, David declared:&mdash;“Out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected
praise.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> And again:&mdash;“The heavens declare the glory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of God.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> When also the soul is in pain it cries aloud
nothing else than the Omega in which it is grieved, so that
the soul on high recognizing its kindred may send it help.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 321.</span>
50. And so far as to this.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> But concerning the beginning
of the 24 elements, she speaks thus:&mdash;Henotes
existed along with Monotes<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> from which (two) came into
being two projections: Monad and the One which, as twice
2, became four. For twice 2 is 4. And again the 2 and
the 4 being added together the number 6 is manifested,
but when these 6 are quadrupled, 24. And these names
of the first Tetrad are understood to be the holiest of holy
things, and cannot be spoken, but are known by the Son
alone. The Father knows also what they are. Those
named by Him in silence and faith are: Arrhetos<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and
Sige, Pater and Aletheia. And the total number of this
Tetrad is 24 elements. For Arrhetos has 7 elements, Sige
5<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and Pater 5 and Aletheia<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> 7. In like manner also the
second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia,
show forth the same number of elements. And the spoken
<span class="sidenote">p. 322.</span>
name of the Saviour, that is Jesus, consists of 6 letters; but
His unspoken (name)<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> from the number of letters taken one
by one, is of 24 elements, but Christ (the) Son of 12.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But
the unspoken (element) in the Chreistos is of 30 letters
and is that of the letters in it, counting the elements one
by one. For the [name] Chreistos is of 8 elements: (<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> for
the Chi<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> is of 3, and the Rho of 2, and the Ei of 2 and the
Iota of 4, the Sigma of 5 and the Tau of 3, while the Ou is
of 2 and the San of 3). Thus they imagine that the unspoken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
element in “Chreistos” is of 30 elements. Wherefore also,
say they, He said “I am Alpha and Omega,” thereby indicating
that the Dove has this number, which is eight hundred
and one.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>51. But Jesus has this ineffable generation.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> For from
the Mother of the Universals the first Tetrad came forth,
as if it were a daughter, and the second Tetrad and an
Ogdoad thus came into being, wherefrom the Decad
<span class="sidenote">p. 323.</span>
proceeded. Thus an Eighteen<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> came into being. Then the
Decad having united with the Ogdoad and making it tenfold,
[the number] 80 [proceeded; and the 80]<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> being again
multiplied by 10, gives birth to the number 800. So that
the total number coming forth from the Ogdoad to the
Decad is 8 and 80 and 800, which is Jesus. For the name
Jesus according to the number in the letters is 888. And
the Greek Alphabet has eight monads and eight decads
and eight hecatontads indicating the cipher of the eight
hundreds as 88, that is the (word) Jesus (made up) from
all the constituent numbers. Wherefore also He is named
Alpha and Omega as signifying the birth from them all.</p>

<p>52. But concerning His fashioning<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> (Marcus) speaks
thus: Powers which emanated from the Second Tetrad
<span class="sidenote">p. 324.</span>
fashioned the Jesus who appeared upon earth, and the
angel Gabriel filled the place<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> of the Logos and the Holy
Spirit that of Zoe, and the power of the Highest<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> (that) of
Anthropos and the Virgin that of Ecclesia. Thus by
incarnation<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> a man was generated by Himself through
Mary. But when He came to the water, there descended
upon Him as a dove he who had ascended on high and had
filled the 12th number,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> in whom existed the seed of those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
who had been sown together<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> in Him, and had descended
together and had ascended together. But this Power
which descended on Him, he says, was the seed of the
Pleroma having within it the Father and the Son, which
through them was known to be the unnamed power of
Sige, and (to be) all the Aeons. And that this was the
Spirit which in Him spake through the mouth of the Son,
confessed Himself to be Son of Man, and manifested the
Father, yet veritably descended into Jesus (and) became
one with Him. The Saviour from the Economy,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> destroyed
death, they say, but Christ Jesus made known the
<span class="sidenote">p. 325.</span>
Father. He says therefore that Jesus was the name of the
man from the Economy, but that it was set forth in resemblance
and shape of the Anthropos who was to come upon
Him; and that when He had received he retained the Anthropos
himself and the Father himself and Arrhetos and
Sige and Aletheia and Ecclesia and Zoe.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>53. I hope then that these things are clearly to all of
sane mind without authority and far from that knowledge
which is according to religion, being (in fact) fragments
of astrological inventions and of the arithmetical art
of the Pythagoreans, as you who love learning will also
know from those their doctrines which we have exposed in
the foregoing books. But in order that we may exhibit
them more clearly to the disciples, not of Christ, but, of
Pythagoras, I will also set forth so far as can be done in
epitome, the things which they have taken from (this last)
concerning the phenomena of the stars. For they say that
these universals are composed from a monad and a dyad,
<span class="sidenote">p. 326.</span>
and counting from a monad up to four, they bring into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
being a decad. And the dyad<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> again going forth up to
Episemon, for example, two and four and six show forth
the dodecad. And, again, if we count in the same way
from the dyad up to the decad, the triacontad appears,
wherein are the ogdoad and decad and dodecad. Then
they say that the dodecad through its containing the Episemon
and because the Episemon closely follows it, is
Passion.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> And since through this, the lapse with regard to
the 12th number occurred, the sheep skipped away and
was lost.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> And in like manner from the decad: and on
this they tell of the drachma which the woman lost and
lamp in hand searched for and of the loss of the one
sheep;<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and having contrasted with this the (number) 99,
they make a fable for themselves of the numbers, since of
the 11 multiplied by 9 they make the number 99, and
thanks to this they say that the Amen contains this
number.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 327.</span>
And of another number they say this:&mdash;the element Eta
with the Episemon is an ogdoad, as it lies in the 8th place
from the Alpha. Then again counting the numbers of the
same elements together without the Episemon and adding
them together as far as the Eta, they display the number 30.
For if one begins the number of the elements with the
Alpha (and continues) up to the Eta (inclusive) after subtracting
the Episemon, one finds the number 30.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Since
then the number 30 is made from the uniting of the three
powers, the same number 30 occurring thrice made 90&mdash;for
three times 30 are 90 [and the same triad multiplied
into itself brought forth 9]. Thus the ogdoad made the
number 99 from the first ogdoad and decad and dodecad.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
The number of which (ogdoad) they sometimes carry to
completion<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and make a triacontad and sometimes deducting
the 12th number they count it 11 and likewise make
the 10th (number) 9. And multiplying and decupling<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 328.</span>
these (figures) they complete the number 99. And since
the 12th Aeon left the 11 [on high] and fell away from
them and came below, they imagine that these things
correspond one to the other. For the type of the letters is
instructive. For the 11th letter is the Lambda which is the
number 30 and is so placed after the likeness of the arrangement
on high,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> since from the Alpha apart from the Episemon,
the number of the same letters up to Lambda when added
together makes up the number 99.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But (they say) that
the Lambda which is put in the 11th place<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> came down to
seek for what is like unto it so that it may complete the
12th number, and having found it did (so) complete it is
plain from the very shape of the element.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> For the Lambda
succeeding as it were in the search for what was like unto
itself and finding, seized it, and filled up with it the place
of the 12th element Mu, which is composed of two
Lambdas.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Wherefore they avoid by this gnosis the place
<span class="sidenote">p. 329.</span>
of the 99 that is to say the Hysterema<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> as the type of the
left hand, but follow the One which added to the 99, brings
them over to the right hand.</p>

<p>54.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But they declare that first the four elements which
they say are fire, water, earth (and) air, were made through
the Mother and projected as an image of the Tetrad on
high. And reckoning in with them their energies, such
as heat, cold, moisture, and dryness they exactly reflect the
Ogdoad. Next, they enumerate ten powers, thus: Seven
circular bodies which they also call heavens, then a circle
encompassing these which they call the Eighth Heaven and
besides these, the Sun and Moon.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> And these making up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the number 10, they declare to be the image of the invisible
decad which is from Logos and Zoe. And (they say) that
the dodecad is revealed through the circle called the Zodiac.
For they declare that the twelve most evident signs shadow
forth the dodecad which is the daughter of Anthropos and
<span class="sidenote">p. 330.</span>
Ecclesia. And since they say the highest heaven has been
linked to the ascension of the universals, the swiftest in
existence, which (heaven) weighs down upon the sphere
itself, and counterbalances by its own weight the swiftness
of the others, so that in thirty years it completes the cycle
from sign to sign&mdash;this they declare to be the image of
Horos encircling their thirty-named Mother.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Again the Moon traversing the heavens completely in
30 days, typifies (they say) by these days the number of
the Aeons. And the Sun completing his journey and
terminating his cyclical return to his former place in 12
months shows forth the Dodecad. And that the days
themselves, since they are measured by 12 hours, are a
type of the mighty<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Ogdoad. And also that the perimeter
of the Zodiacal circle has 360 degrees and that each Zodiacal
sign has 30. Thus by means of the circle, they say, the
<span class="sidenote">p. 331.</span>
image of the connection of the 12 with the 30 is observed.
And again also they imagine that the earth is divided into
12 climates, and that each several climate receives a single
power from the heavens immediately above it<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and produces
children of the same essence with the power sending
down [this influence] by emanation [which is they say] a
type of the Dodecad on high.</p>

<p>55. And besides this, they say that the Demiurge of the
Ogdoad on high,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> wishing to imitate the Boundless and
Everlasting and Unconfined and Timeless One and not
being able to form a model of His stability and permanence,
because he was himself the fruit of the Hysterema, was
forced to place in it for rendering it eternal, times and
seasons and numbers, thinking that by the multitude of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
times he was imitating the Boundless One. But they
declare that in this the truth having escaped him, he followed
the false; and that therefore when the times are fulfilled,
his work will be dissolved.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 332.</span>
56. These things, then, those who are from the school
of Valentinus declare concerning Creation and the Universe,
every time producing something newer<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> (than the last).
And they consider this to be fructification, if any one
similarly discovering something greater appears to work
wonders. And finding in each case from the Scriptures
something accordant with the aforesaid numbers, they prate
of Moses and the Prophets, imagining them to declare allegorically
the dimensions of the Aeons. Which things it
does not seem to me expedient to explain as they are senseless
and inconsistent, and already the blessed elder Irenæus
has marvellously and painfully refuted their doctrines.
From whom also [we have taken] their so-called discoveries
and have shown that they, having appropriated these things
from (the) trifling<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> of the Pythagorean philosophy and
the astrologies, accuse Christ of having handed them
down. But since I consider that their senseless doctrines
have been sufficiently set forth, and that it has been already
proved whose disciples Marcus and Colarbasus<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> by becoming
the successors of the school of Valentinus (really)
are, let us see also what Basilides says.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Simon Magus, the convert of Philip the Evangelist, is said by all
patristic writers to be at once the first teacher and the founder of all
(post-Christian) Gnosticism; but until the discovery of our text our
knowledge of his doctrines hardly went further than the statements of
St. Irenæus and Epiphanius that he claimed to be the Supreme Being.
The only other light on the subject came from Theodoret, who, writing
in the fifth century, discloses in a few brief words the assertion by
Simon of a system of aeons or inferior powers emanating from the
Divinity by pairs. It is plain that in this, Theodoret must have either
borrowed from, or used the same material as, our author, and it is now
seen that Simon’s aeons were said by him to be six in number, the sources
of all subsequent being, and to be considered under a double aspect.
On the one hand, they were names or attributes of God like the
Amshaspands of Zoroastrianism or the Sephiroth of the Jewish
Cabala; and on the other they were identified with natural objects
such as Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, Earth and Water, thereby
forming a link with the Orphic and other cosmogonies current in Greece
and the East. We now learn, too, for the first time that Simon taught,
like the Ophites, that the Supreme Being was of both sexes like his antitypes,
that the universe consisted of three worlds reflecting one
another, and that man must achieve his salvation by coming to resemble
the Deity&mdash;a result which was apparently to be brought about by
finding his twin soul and uniting himself to her. None of these ideas
seem to have been Simon’s own invention, and all are found among
those of earlier or later Gnostics. Hence their appearance has here
given rise to the theories, put forward in the first instance by German
writers, but also adopted by some English ones, that the Simon of our
text was not the magician of the <i>Acts</i> but an heresiarch of the same name
who flourished in the second century, and that the opponent of St. Peter
covers under the same name the personality of St. Paul. Neither
theory seems to have any foundation.</p>

in something like his own words. He seems to postulate the existence
of a Logos who makes the Six Powers or Roots and who is himself
present in them all. This does not appear to differ from the view of
Philo, for which see <i>Forerunners</i>, I, 174, or Schürer’s <i>Hist. of the Jewish

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> Νοῦς καὶ Ἐπίνοιαν, Φωνὴ καὶ Ὄνομα, Λογισμὸς καὶ Ἐνθύμησις. The
last name is the only one that presents any difficulty, although every
heresiologist but Hippolytus gives the female of the first syzygy as
Ἔννοια. Ἐνθύμησις is translated <i>Conceptio</i> by Cruice, “Reflection” by
Macmahon. It seems as if it here meant “desire” in a mental, not a
fleshly, sense; but as this word has a double meaning in English, I
have substituted for it “Passion.” Hereafter the Greek names will be
used.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> This daring idea that the Logos, the chief intermediary between
God and matter in whom all the lesser λόγοι and powers were contained,
as Philo thought, must himself either return to and be united
to God or else be lost in matter and perish, is met with in one form
or another in nearly all later forms of Gnosticism. It is this which
makes the redemption of Sophia after her “fall” so prominent in the
mythology of Valentinus, while its converse is shown in the First Man
of Manichæism conquered by Satan and groaning in chains and
darkness until released by the heavenly powers and placed in some
intermediate world to wait until the last spark of the light which
he has lost is redeemed from matter. It seems to be the natural
consequence of Philo’s ideas, for which see Schürer’s <i>Hist. of the Jewish
People</i> (Eng. ed.) II, ii. pp. 370-376. Whether these did not in turn
owe something to Greek stories of mortals like Heracles and Dionysos
deified as a reward for their sufferings is open to question. Cf.
<i>Forerunners</i>, vol. I.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> Justinus also used this quotation from Isaiah i. 2, although in

for “disregarded.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> So Philo according to Zeller and Schürer, (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 374) understands
by the Logos “the power of God or the active Divine intelligence in
general.” He designates it as the “idea which comprises all other
ideas, the power which comprises all powers in itself, as the entirety
of the supersensuous world or of the Divine powers.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">[77]</a> The sources of this chapter are fairly plain. There is little reason
to doubt that Hippolytus had actually seen and read a book attributed
to Simon Magus and called the <i>Great Announcement</i> from which he
quotes, after his manner, inaccurately and carelessly, but still in good
faith. Whether the work was by Simon himself is much more doubtful,
but it was probably in use by the sect that he founded, and therefore
represents with some fidelity his teaching. The style of it as appears
from the extracts here given is a curious mixture of bombast and
philosophical expressions, and bears a strong likeness to certain
passages in the chapters in the fifth book on the Naassenes and the
Peratæ. The other traceable source of the chapter is the work
<i>Against Heresies</i> of St. Irenæus, of which the quotations here given
go to establish the Greek text. But intertwined with this, especially
towards the end of the chapter, is a third thread of tradition, quite
different from that used in the <i>Clementines</i> and other patristic accounts
of Simon’s career, which cannot at present be identified.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> With Valentinus, we leave at last the tangled genealogies and
unclean imagery, as it seems to us, of the early traditions of Western
Asia, to approach a form of religion which although not without fantastic
features is yet much more consonant with modern European
thought. Valentinus was, indeed, with the doubtful exception of
Marcion, the first of heretics in the present acceptation of the term,
and many features of his teaching were reproduced later in the tenets
of one or other of the Christian sects. At first sight, the main difference
between his doctrine and that of the Catholic Church consists in the
extraordinary series of personified attributes of the Deity which he
thought fit to interpose between the Supreme Being and the Saviour.
This he probably borrowed either from the later Zoroastrian idea of
the Amshaspands or Archangels who surround Ahura Mazda, or, more
probably, from the <i>paut neteru</i>, (“company of the gods”) of the
Egyptian religion of Pharaonic times; and it has been suggested
elsewhere that he probably attached less importance to dogmatism on
the matter than the Fathers would wish to make out. But Hippolytus’
account of his other doctrines show other divergences from the Church’s
teaching both graver and wider than we should have gathered from the
statements of Irenæus, Tertullian, or Epiphanius. His view of the
ignorance and folly of the Demiurge seems to be taken over bodily
from the Ophite teaching, and, as he identifies him by implication
with the God of the Jews, must logically lead to the rejection of the
whole of the Old Testament except perhaps the Psalms, Proverbs, and
the historical portions. He is also as predestinarian as Calvin himself,
for he assigns complete beatitude to the Pneumatics or Spirituals only,
while relegating the Psychics to an inferior heaven and dooming the
Hylics to complete destruction. Yet the class to which each of us is
assigned has nothing to do with conduct, but is in the discretion of
Sophia, the Mother of all Living.</p>

<p>The most marked novelty in Valentinus’ teaching, however, is the
cause, according to him, of the gift of this partial salvation to man.
This is not, as in the Catholic, the fruit of God’s love towards his
creature, but the last stage of a great scheme for the reconstruction
and purification of the whole universe. First, the Pleroma or Fulness
of the Godhead is purified by the segregation from it of the Ectroma
or abortion to which Sophia in her ignorance and ambition gave
birth; then the Ectroma herself is freed from her passions by the
action of Christ and the Holy Spirit, and made the Mother of Life;
and finally this material world, the creation of the God of the Jews,
is to be purged by the Divine Mission of Jesus from the gross and
devilish elements introduced into it by the ignorant clumsiness of the
same God of the Jews. But this theory was poles asunder from the
geocentric ideas of the universe then current among Greeks, Jews, and
Christians alike, and comes startlingly near the hypotheses of modern
science on the very low place of the earth and humanity in the scheme
of things. Whence Valentinus drew the materials from which he constructed
his theory must be reserved for investigation at some future
date; but it is fairly clear that some part of it was responsible for not
a few of the tenets of the Manichæism which arose some hundred years
later to maintain a strenuous opposition to the Catholic faith for at
least nine centuries.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be said that Hippolytus also tells us for the first time
of the divisions among Valentinus’ followers and the different parts
played therein by Ptolemy, Heracleon and others, including that
Bardesanes or Bar Daisan whose name was great in the East as late
as Al Bîrûnî’s day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_157" href="#FNanchor_157" class="label">[157]</a> This passage alone is sufficient to make one doubtful as to the

<p><a id="Footnote_162" href="#FNanchor_162" class="label">[162]</a> So that Hippolytus’ attempt to show that Valentinus plagiarized
from Plato resolves itself into an imaginative interpretation of a purposely
obscure passage in an epistle which is only doubtfully assigned
to Plato. That Valentinus like every one educated in the Greek
learning was influenced by Plato is likely enough, but that there was
any conscious borrowing of tenets is against probability.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="label">[165]</a> Of the sources from which the author of the <i>Philosophumena</i> drew
this account of Valentinus’ doctrine, much has been written. Hilgenfeld
in his <i>Ketzergeschichte des Urchristenthums</i>, and Lipsius in the
article “Valentinus” in Smith &amp; Wace’s <i>D.C.B.</i>, agree that its main
source is the writings of Heracleon. Cruice, <i>Études sur les Philosophumena</i>,
on the other hand, thinks it largely composed of extracts
from a work of Valentinus himself, entitled <i>Sophia</i>. Salmon (<i>Hermathena</i>,
1885, p. 391), while not committing himself to a definite pronouncement
as to the writer quoted, says that Hippolytus undoubtedly
quoted from a genuine Valentinian treatise, and that this last is above
the suspicion of forgery with which he is inclined to view other
quotations in the <i>Philosophumena</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_166" href="#FNanchor_166" class="label">[166]</a> The notice of the followers, real or supposed, of Valentinus which
occupies the remainder of Book VI adds little to our previous knowledge
of their doctrines, being taken almost <i>verbatim</i> from the work of
Hippolytus’ teacher, St. Irenæus. It is noteworthy, however, that
although the Table of Contents promises us an account of (among
others) Heracleon, nothing is here said of him, although that shrewd
critic of the Gospels was thought worthy of refutation by Origen some
fifty years later. Yet Hippolytus mentions Heracleon as being with
Ptolemy a leader of the Italic School of Valentinians which seems to
dispose of the theory advanced by Lipsius (Smith &amp; Wace’s <i>D.C.B.</i>,
s. v. “Valentinus”) that Heracleon was the author from whom Hippolytus
took his account of Valentinus’ own doctrine. Of Secundus
nothing more is known than is set down in the text, while the
“Epiphanes” here mentioned is thought by some to be not a name,
but an adjective, so that the passage would read “a certain <i>illustrious</i>
teacher of theirs.” This was certainly the reading of Irenæus’ Latin
translator, who renders the word by “<i>clarus</i>.” Is this a roundabout
way of describing Heracleon? As to this see Salmon in <i>D.C.B.</i>, s. v.
“Heracleon.”</p>

So Irenæus, I, xi. 3, p. 104, H. In his note Harvey says that the

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_179" href="#FNanchor_179" class="label">[179]</a> This Marcus is practically only known to us from the statements
of Irenæus, from which the accounts in the text and in the later work
of Epiphanius are copied. Salmon’s argument (<i>D.C.B.</i>, s. v. “Marcus”)
that Marcus taught in Asia Minor or Syria, and that Irenæus himself
only knew his doctrines from his writings and the confessions of his
Gaulish followers on their conversion to Catholicism seems irrefutable.
There is no reason to doubt Irenæus’ statement here repeated that
Marcus was a magician, nor the generally accepted statement of
modern writers on Gnosticism that he was a Jew. This last deduction
is supported by his use of Hebrew formulas, of which Irenæus gives
many examples, including one beginning “βασημαχαμοσση” which
appears to be “In the name of Achamoth,” the Hebrew or Aramaic
equivalent of the Greek Sophia. A more cogent argument is that his
identification of the Gnostic Aeons with the letters of the Greek
alphabet and their numerical values is, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, exactly correspondent
to that of the so-called “practical Cabala” of the Jews which
was re-introduced into Europe in the tenth to twelfth centuries, but which
probably goes back to pre-Christian times and is ultimately derived from
the decayed relics of the Chaldæan and Egyptian religions. On the other
hand, Irenæus’ classing of Marcus among the “successors” or followers
of Valentinus is much more open to question. The reverence he shows
for the books of the Old Testament and for the Pentateuchal account
of the Creation, which is indeed the foundation of the greater part of
the system of the Cabala, is inconsistent with the views of Valentinus,
who as we have seen (n. on p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a> <i>supra</i>) must logically have rejected
the inspiration of the Old Testament altogether. St. Jerome (Ep. 75, <i>ad
Theod.</i>, I, 449), says indeed that Marcus was a Basilidian, and although
we have too little of Basilides’ own writings to check this statement,
it is not impossible that the nomenclature of the Aeons, which is the
chief point in which Valentinus and Marcus coincide, was common to
all three heretics, and perhaps drawn from a source earlier than them
all. The language of the formulas given by Irenæus but not reproduced
by Hippolytus, in several instances bear a strong likeness to that of the
<i>Great Announcement</i> attributed in the earlier part of this Book to
Simon Magus.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> Like the rest of this section and most of this chapter, Hippolytus
here follows Irenæus <i>verbatim</i>. Why the apparition of the Tetrad
should be more supportable in female than in male shape can only be
guessed; but the frequent personification of the Great Goddess of
Western Asia may have had something to do with it.</p>

στοιχεῖον as meaning both “letter” and “element.” In the Magic
Papyrus of Leyden which calls itself “Monas, the 8th (book?) of
Moses,” there is a curious account of how the light and the rest of
creation were brought into being by the successive words or rather the
laughter of the Creator. Cf. Leemans, <i>Papyri Græci</i>, etc., Leyden,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_206" href="#FNanchor_206" class="label">[206]</a> The primitive Church attributed great power to the ritual utterance
of the word Amen. Thus Ignatius’ second Epistle to the Ephesians:
“There was hidden from the ruler of this world the virginity of Mary,
and the birth of our Lord, and the three mysteries of the shout&nbsp;... and
hereby&nbsp;... magic began to be dissolved and all bonds to be loosed
and the ancient kingdom and the error of evil, is destroyed” (Cureton’s
translation, London, 1845, p. 15); but Lightfoot would read κήροξις,
“proclamation,” for κραυγή, “shout.” In the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> the word
Amen is used to denote a class of Powers concerned apparently with
the organization of the Kerasmos or semi-material world and called
sometimes “the Three” and sometimes “the Seven Amens.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_291" href="#FNanchor_291" class="label">[291]</a> Κολάρβασος. The name which is repeated by Tertullian, Philaster
and Theodoret can be traced back to the single passage in Irenæus,
where it appears in connection with the name Σιγή as “the Sige of
Colarbasus.” A German commentator long since suggested that it
was not the name of a brother heretic or follower of Marcus, but a
corruption of the words קל־ארבע Qol-Arba, or the “Voice of the Four,”
and this seems now generally accepted. As most if not all of
Marcus’ pretended revelations are said to have been dictated to him by
an apparition of the Supreme Tetrad, he may well have called the book
in which they were written and which seems to have been known to
Irenæus, by some such name.</p>

heresy from them.</p>

<p>3. And what things Satornilus, who flourished at the same
time as Basilides, says.</p>

<p>4. How Menander set himself to declare that the world
came into being by angels.</p>

<p>5. What was the madness of Marcion, and that his

but comes from Empedocles.</p>

<p>6. How Carpocrates talks foolishness, and thinks existing
things to have been produced by angels.</p>

being moved by the doctrines of the physicists, supposed
an essence for the universe.</p>

13. Seeing that the doctrines of the heretics are like a
sea lashed into waves by the force of the winds, their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
hearers ought to sail through them in quest of the calm
harbour. For such a sea is both wild and hard to overpass,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
as the Sicilian (sea) is said to be, wherein are fabled
to be Cyclops and Charybdis and Scylla and&nbsp;... the
Sirens’ rock.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Which sea the Greek poets make out that
Odysseus sailed through, skilfully availing himself of the
terror of those fierce beasts: for their cruelty to those
sailing among them was notorious. But the Sirens, singing
clearly and musically for the beguiling of those sailing past,
persuaded with their sweet voices those who listened to
approach them. And they say that Odysseus, hearing this,
stopped with wax his companions’ ears, but having had
himself bound to the mast sailed without danger past the
Sirens while listening to their song. Which I advise those
who meet with them to do, and either having on account
of weakness stopped their ears with wax to sail through the
teachings of the heretics without listening to what, like the
shrill song of the Sirens, might easily persuade them to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
pleasure; or else to bind themselves to the Cross of Christ,
hearkening faithfully (to Him) and (thus) not to be
harassed, being persuaded (only) by Him to whom they
<span class="sidenote">p. 336.</span>
are bound and standing upright.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>14. Since now we have set forth in the six Books before
this, the (opinions) which have gone before, it seems now
that we should not keep silent about those of Basilides
which are those of Aristotle the Stagirite, and not of Christ.
But although the doctrines of Aristotle have been before
expounded, we shall not shrink from now setting them
forth in epitome, so that the teacher by their closer comparison
may readily perceive that the sophisms of Basilides
are those of Aristotle.</p>

<p>15. Aristotle, then, divides being<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> into three. For one
part of it is genus, another, as he says, species,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and another
something undivided.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But the atom is so called, not because
<span class="sidenote">p. 337.</span>
of the smallness of its body, but because by its nature
it can in no way be cut. But the genus is, as it were, a
heap composed of many different seeds. From which
heap-resembling genus, all the species of existent things are
severed;<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and it is (one) genus which is sufficient for all
things which have come into being. In order that this
may be clear, I will point out an example whereby the
whole theory of the Peripatetic can be retraced.</p>

<p>16. Let us say that there exists simply “animal,”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> not any
particular animal. This “animal” is neither ox, nor horse,
nor man, nor god, nor anything else that can anyhow be
apparent, but simply “animal.” From this “animal” the
species of all animals have their substance.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And the
undifferentiated<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “animal” is the substance of the animals
who have been produced in species<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but is yet none of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
them. For an animal is man, who takes his beginning
<span class="sidenote">p. 338.</span>
from that “animal,” and an animal is horse who does likewise.
The horse and ox and dog and each of the other
animals takes its beginning from the simple “animal”
which is none of them.</p>

<p>17. But if that “animal” is not one of these, (then) the
substance of the things which have been produced has,
according to Aristotle, come into being from the things
which are not: for the “animal” whence these have
severally received it is not one (of them). But, while being
none (of them), it has become the one beginning of things
which are. But who it is who has sent down this beginning<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
of the things which have been produced later, we
shall see when we come to its proper place.</p>

<p>18. Since the threefold essence is, as he says, genus, species
and atom, and we have granted<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> “animal” to be genus,
and man to be species already differentiated from the
multitude of animals, but at the same time commingled
with them and not yet transformed into a species of substantial
being,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;I, when I give form to the man taken
apart from the genus, call him by the name of Socrates
<span class="sidenote">p. 339.</span>
or of Diogenes or any one of the many names (there are),
and when I (thus) restrict with a name the man who from
genus has become species, I call such being an individual.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
For the genus is divided into species and the species into
an atom; but the atom when restricted by a name cannot
by its nature be divided into anything else, as we have
divided each of the things aforesaid.</p>

<p>This Aristotle calls essence in its first, chief, and
strictest sense, nor is it said of any subject nor as
existing in any subject.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But he speaks of the subject as
if it were genus when he said “animal” of all the animals
severally ranged under it, such as an ox, a horse, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
rest, describing them by a common name. For it is true
to say that man is an animal, and a horse is an animal and
an ox is an animal and all the rest. This is subjective, the
one (name) being likewise capable of being said of many
<span class="sidenote">p. 340.</span>
and different species.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> For neither a horse nor an ox differs
from man <i>quâ</i> animal; for the definition of animal fits all
the aforesaid animals alike. For what is an animal? If we
define it, a common definition will include all the animals.
For an animal is a living,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> feeling being, such as a man, a
horse and all the rest. But, “in the Subject,” he says, is
that which exists in anything, not as part of it, but as being
incapable of existing apart from that wherein it is, (and is)
each<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the accidents of being. The which is called
Quality because by it we say <i>what</i> certain things are, as,
for instance, white, green, black, just, unjust, prudent and
such like. But none of these (qualities) can come into
being by itself, but must needs be in<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> something. But,
if neither the “animal,” which is the word I use for all
living beings taken severally, nor the “accidents” which
are found to occur in all of them, can come into being of
themselves, then from those things which do not exist,
the individual things<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> are developed and the triply-divided
essence is not compounded<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> from other things. Hence
Being<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> so called in its first and chiefest and strictest sense,
<span class="sidenote">p. 341.</span>
exists according to Aristotle from those things which do not
exist.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>19. About Being<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> then enough has been said. But
Being is called not only genus, species and individual; but
also matter, form and privation. But there is no difference
among these while the division stands. And Being being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
such as it is, the ordering of the cosmos came about
automatically in the same way. The cosmos is according
to Aristotle divided into many [and different] parts;
[and] the part of the cosmos which exists from the earth as
far as the moon is without providence or governance and
has its rise only in its own nature. But that which is
beyond the moon, is ordered with all order and providence
and is (so) governed up to the surface of heaven. But the
(same) surface is a certain fifth essence renewed from all
the elements of nature wherefrom the cosmos is made up,
and this is Aristotle’s “Quintessence,” being as it were a
hypercosmic essence. And his system of philosophy is
<span class="sidenote">p. 342.</span>
divided so as to agree with the division of the cosmos. For
there is by him a treatise on physics called <i>Acroasis</i>, wherein
he has treated of the doings of Nature, not of Providence,
from the Earth to the Moon. And there is also his <i>Metaphysics</i>,
another special work thus entitled, concerning the
things which take place beyond the Moon. And there is
also his work <i>On the Quintessence</i>, wherein he theologizes.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Like this also is the division of the universals as they are
defined by type in Aristotle’s philosophy. But his work
<i>On the Soul</i> is puzzling; for it would be impossible in three
whole books to say what Aristotle thinks about the soul.
For what he gives as the definition of the soul is easy to
say; but what is explained by the definition is hard to find.
For, he says, the soul is an entelechy of the physical
organism. What this is would need many words and great
enquiry. But the God who is the cause of all these fair beings
<span class="sidenote">p. 343.</span>
is one, even to one speculating for a very long time, more
difficult to be known than is the soul. Yet the definition
which Aristotle gives of God, is not hard to be known, but
impossible to be understood. For He, he says, is a conception
of conception which is altogether non-existent.
But the cosmos is according to Aristotle imperishable and
eternal; for it contains nothing faulty and is governed by
Nature and Providence. And Aristotle has not only put
forth books on Nature and the Cosmos and Providence
and God,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but there is also a certain treatise by him on
ethics which is called <i>The Ethical Books</i> wherein he builds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
up a good ethics for his hearers out of a poor one. If,
then, Basilides be found not only potentially but in the
very words and names to have transferred the doctrines of
Aristotle to our evangelical and soul-saving teaching, what
remains but by restoring these extraneous matters to their
(proper) authors to prove to Basilides’ disciples that, as
they are heathenish, Christ will profit them nothing?</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 344.</span>
20. Now Basilides and Isidore, Basilides’ true son and
disciple, say that Matthias recounted to them secret<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> discourses
which he had heard from the Saviour in private
teaching.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> We see then how plainly Basilides together
with Isidore and their whole band belie not only Matthias
but also the Saviour. There was, he says, [a time] when
Nothing was, not even the nothing of existing things, but
baldly and unreservedly and without any sophism, nothing
at all. But when I say, says he, that [this] <i>was</i>, I do not
say that this existed, but I speak thus to signify what I
wish to indicate. I say then that nothing at all existed.
For, says he, that which is named is plainly not ineffable;
for at any rate we call one thing ineffable, but another not
ineffable. For truly that which is not even ineffable is not
named ineffable, but is, he says, above every name which is
named. For neither are there names enough for the cosmos,
he says, so diverse is it, but there is a lack of them. Nor do
<span class="sidenote">p. 345.</span>
I undertake, says he, to find proper names for everything;
but one must silently understand in the mind not their
names, but the properties of the things named. For identity
of names has made confusion and error concerning things<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
among those who hear them. And they who first made
this appropriation and theft from the Peripatetic lead astray
the folly of those who herd with them. For Aristotle who
was born many generations earlier than Basilides, was the
first to set forth in the <i>Categories</i> a system of homonyms
which these men expound as their own and as a novelty
[derived] from the secret discourses of Matthias.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
21. When nothing [existed], neither matter, nor essence,
nor the simple nor the compound, nor [that which is
conceived by the mind] nor that which cannot be [so]
conceived, [nor that which is perceived by the senses]<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> nor
that which cannot be [so] perceived, nor man, nor angel,
nor God, nor generally any of the things which are named
or apprehended by sensation, or of things<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> which can be
<span class="sidenote">p. 346.</span>
conceived by the mind but can be thus and even more
minutely described by all:&mdash;(then) [the] God-who-was-Not&mdash;whom
Aristotle calls Concept of Concept, but (Basilides)
Him-who-is-Not, without conception, perception, counsel,
choice, passion or desire willed to create a cosmos. But
I say (only) for the sake of clearness, says he, that He willed.
I signify that he did this without will or conception or perception;
and [the] cosmos was not that which later became
established in its expanse and diversity,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but a Seed of a
cosmos. And the Seed of the cosmos contained all things
within itself, as the grain of mustard (seed) collects into the
smallest space and contains within itself all things at once:&mdash;the
roots, stem, branches and the numberless leaves, with
the seeds begotten by the plant, and often again those
grown by many other plants. Thus the God-who-was-Not
made the cosmos from things which were not,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> casting
<span class="sidenote">p. 347.</span>
down and planting<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> a certain single seed containing within
itself the whole seed-mass<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of the cosmos. But in order
that I may make clearer what these (men) say, it was even
as an egg of some gorgeous and parti-coloured bird such as
a peacock of some other yet more variegated and many-coloured,
contains within it, though one, many patterns<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of
multiform and many-coloured and diversely-constructed
beings<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>&mdash;so, says he, the non-existent seed of the cosmos
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
cast down by the God-who-was-Not contained (a Seed-mass)
at once multiform and (the source) of many beings.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>22. All things, then, which are to be described, and
those which not having yet been discovered must be left out
of the account, were destined to be fitted for the cosmos
which was to come into being at the proper time by the
help given to it by such and so great a God, whose quality<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
the creature can neither conceive nor define. And these
things existed stored within the seed, as, in a new-born
<span class="sidenote">p. 348.</span>
child, we see teeth and the power of fatherhood and brains
accrue later; and those things which belong to the man
but do not at first exist, evolve gradually out of the child.
For it would be impossible to say that any projection by the
God-who-was-Not became something non-existent,&mdash;since
Basilides entirely shuns and has in horror [the notion of]
substances of things begotten [arising] by way of projection.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
For what, says he, is the need of projection or of any substructure
of matter in order that God may fashion a cosmos
as the spider makes webs, or mortal man takes brass or
wood or some other portion of matter to work with?).&mdash;But
He spoke, says he, and it came to pass; and this is, as these
[heretics] say, what Moses spake:&mdash;“Let there be light
and there was light.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Whence, says he, came the light?
From nothing. For it is not written says he, whence it
came, but only that it came forth from the word of the
speaker. For the speaker, says he, was not, nor did that
which was spoken [formerly] exist. The seed of the cosmos,
he says, came into being from non-existent things [and this
seed is] the word which was spoken: “Let there be light.”
And this, says he, is the saying in the Gospels: “This is
<span class="sidenote">p. 349.</span>
the true light which lighteneth every man who cometh into
the world.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It takes its beginnings<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> from that seed and
gives light. This is the seed which contains within itself all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
the Seed-Mass which Aristotle says is the genus divided
into boundless species, since we divide from the non-existent
animal ox, horse [and] man. Further, of the
underlying cosmic seed, they say, “whatever I may say
came into being after this, seek not to know whence it
came.” For it contained all seeds stored and shut up
within itself, as it were things which were not, but which
were foreordained to exist by the God-who-was-Not.</p>

<p>Let us see then what they say came into being in the
first, second or third place from the cosmic seed. There
existed (Basilides) says within the seed itself, a Sonhood,
threefold throughout, of the same essence<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> with the God-who-was-Not
and begotten of the things that were not. Of
this triple divided Sonhood, one part was subtle, (one
coarse) and one wanting purification. Now the subtle (part)
<span class="sidenote">p. 350.</span>
straightway and as it became the first emission of the seed
by the One-who-was-Not, escaped and ascended and went
on high from below with the speed described by the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“like wing or thought,”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">and came, he says, before the One-who-was-Not. For
towards him every nature strains on account of his exceeding
beauty and bloom,<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but each differently. But the coarser
part still remaining in the seed, although resembling the
other,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> could not go on high, for it lacked the fineness of
division which the ascending Sonhood had of itself, and
was (therefore) left behind. Then the coarser Sonhood
wings itself with some such wing as that wherewith Plato,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Aristotle’s teacher, equips the soul in the <i>Phaedrus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and
Basilides calls the same not a wing but Holy Spirit, clothed
wherewith the Sonhood both gives and receives benefit.
It gives it because a bird’s wing taken by itself and severed
from the bird would neither become uplifted nor high in
<span class="sidenote">p. 351.</span>
air, nor would the bird be uplifted and high in air if deprived
of the wing. This then is the relation which the Sonhood
bears to the Spirit and the Spirit to the Sonhood. For the
Sonhood borne aloft by the Spirit as by a wing bears aloft
the wing, (that is the Spirit) and draws nigh to the subtler
Sonhood and to the God-who-was-Not and fashions all
things from the non-existent. But [the Spirit] cannot abide
with the Sonhood for it is not of the same essence,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> nor has
it the same nature as the Sonhood. But just as dry and
pure air is naturally fatal to fishes, so naturally to the Holy
Spirit was that place, more ineffable than the ineffable ones
and higher than all names, which is the seat at once of the
God-who-was-Not and of the [first] Sonhood. Therefore
the Sonhood left the Spirit near that blessed place which
cannot be conceived nor characterized<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> by any speech,
[yet] not altogether alone nor [completely] severed from the
Sonhood. For just as when a sweet perfume is poured into
a jar, even if the jar is carefully emptied a certain fragrance
of the perfume still remains and is left behind, and although
<span class="sidenote">p. 352.</span>
the perfume be removed from the jar, the jar retains the
fragrance, but not the perfume&mdash;so the Holy Spirit remained
bereft of and severed from the Sonhood. And this is the
saying: “As the perfume on Aaron’s head ran down to his
beard.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This is the savour carried down by the Holy
Spirit from on high into the Formlessness<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and Space of
this world of ours, whence the Sonhood first went on high
as on the wings of an eagle and borne on his loins. For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
all things, he says, strain upward from below, from the
worse to the better. But there is thus nothing of those
things which are among the better which is immovable, so
that it cannot come below. But the third Sonhood, he
says, which is in need of purification, remains in the great
heap of the Seed-mass giving and receiving benefits. And
in what manner it does this, we shall see later in the fitting
place.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 353.</span>
23. Now when the first and second ascensions of the
Sonhood<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> had come to pass, and the Holy Spirit remained
by itself in the way described, being set midway between
the hypercosmic firmaments and the cosmos&mdash;for Basilides
divides the things that are into two first made and
primary divisions, one of which is called by him an ordered
world,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the other hypercosmic things&mdash;and between
these two [he places] the Boundary Spirit,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which same
is at once Holy and holds abiding in it the savour of the
Sonhood, it being the firmament which is above the heaven.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
[When these ascensions had taken place], there escaped
from and was engendered from the cosmical seed and the
Seed-mass, the Great Ruler, the head of the cosmos, a
certain beauty and greatness and power which cannot
be spoken.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> For he is, says [Basilides], more ineffable
than the ineffable ones, mightier than the mighty, and
better than all the fair ones you can describe. He, when
engendered, burst through, soared aloft, and was borne
right up on high as far as the firmament, but stayed there
thinking that the firmament was the end of all ascension
<span class="sidenote">p. 354.</span>
and uplifting and not imagining that there was anything
at all beyond this. And he became wiser, mightier, more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
eminent, and more luminous and everything which you can
describe as excelling in beauty all the other cosmic things
which lay before him, save only the Sonhood left behind
in the Seed-mass. For he knew not that [this Sonhood] was
wiser and mightier and better than he. Therefore he deemed
himself Lord and King<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and wise architect, and set about
the creation in detail<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of the ordered world. And in the
first place he did not think it meet for him to be alone,
but created for himself and engendered from the things
which lay below him a Son much better and wiser than
himself. For all this the God-who-was-Not had foreordained
when he let fall the Seed-mass. When, therefore,
[the Great Ruler] beheld his Son, he wondered, and was
filled with love and astounded: for so [splendid] did the
beauty of the son appear to the Great Ruler. And the
Ruler seated him at his right hand. This is what is called
by Basilides the Ogdoad where sits the Great Ruler. Then
the Great Wise Demiurge fashioned the whole of the
<span class="sidenote">p. 355.</span>
heavenly, that is, the aethereal creation. But the Son begotten
by him set it working and established it, being much
wiser than the Demiurge himself.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>24. This [creation] is according to Aristotle, the “entelechy”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
of the organic natural body, the soul activating
the body, without which the body can effect nothing, a
something greater and more manifest and wiser than the
body. The theory therefore which Aristotle first taught
regarding the soul and the body, Basilides explained as
referring to the Great Ruler and his so-called son. For
the Ruler according to Basilides begat a son; and Aristotle
says that the soul is an entelechy, the work and result<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of
the organic natural body. As, then, the entelechy controls
the body, so the son, according to Basilides, controls the
more ineffable God of the Ineffables. All things soever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
then which are in the aether up to the Moon are foreseen
and controlled by the majesty<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of the Great Ruler; for
here [<i>i. e.</i> at the Moon] the air is divided from the aether.
Now when all aethereal things had been set in order, yet
<span class="sidenote">p. 356.</span>
another Ruler ascends from the Seed-Mass, greater than all
the things which are below him, save only the Sonhood
which is left behind, but much inferior to the first Ruler.
And this one is called by them “able to be named.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> And
his place is called Hebdomad, and he is the controller
and Demiurge of all things lying below him, and he has
created to himself from the Seed-Mass a Son who is more
foreseeing and wiser than he in the same way as has been
said about the first [Ruler]. And in this space,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> he says,
are the heap and the Seed-Mass, and events naturally happen
as they were (ordained) to be produced in advance by Him
who has calculated that which will come to pass and when
and what and how it will be.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> And of these there is no
leader nor guardian nor demiurge. For that calculation
which the Non-Existent One made when he created them
suffices for them.</p>

<p>25. When, then, according to them, the whole cosmos
and the hypercosmic things were completed, and nothing
<span class="sidenote">p. 357.</span>
was lacking, there still remained in the Seed-Mass the
third Sonhood which had been left behind to give and
receive benefits in the Seed. And the Sonhood left behind
had to be revealed and again established on high above
the Boundary Spirit in the presence of the subtler Sonhood
and the one that resembles it and the Non-Existent
One, as, says he, it is written, “All creation groans and is
in travail in expectation of the revelation of the sons of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> We spiritual men, he say, left here below for the
arrangement and perfect formation and rectification and
completion of the souls which by nature have to remain
in this [Middle] Space, are the “sons [of God].” “Now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
from Adam to Moses sin reigned”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> as it is written. For
the Great Ruler reigned who held sway up to the firmament,
thinking that he alone was God, and that there was
nothing higher than he. For all things were kept hidden
in silence. This, says he, is the mystery which was not
known to the earlier generations; but in those times the
King and Lord, as it seemed to him, of the universals was
<span class="sidenote">p. 358.</span>
the Great Ruler, the Ogdoad. Yet of this [Middle] Space
the Hebdomad was King and Lord, and the Ogdoad is
ineffable but the Hebdomad may be named. This Ruler
of the Hebdomad, says he, it was who spoke to Moses,
saying, “I am the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
and the name of God was not made known to them:”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> for
thus they will have it to have been written&mdash;that is to say
[the name] of the Ineffable Ogdoad, Ruler, God. All the
prophets therefore who were before the Saviour, spoke from
that place.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> When then, he says, the sons of God had to
be revealed to us, about whom, he says, creation groaned
and travailed in expectation of the revelation, the Gospel
came into the cosmos and passed through every Dominion<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and Authority and Lordship and every name which is
named. And it came indeed, although nothing descended
from on high, nor did the Blessed Sonhood come forth
from that Incomprehensible and Blessed God-who-was-Not.
But as the Indian naphtha, when only kindled from afar off,
takes fire, so from the Formlessness of the heap below do
<span class="sidenote">p. 359.</span>
the powers of the Sonhood extend upward. For as if he
were something of naphtha, the son of the Great Ruler of
the Ogdoad catches and receives the concepts from the
Blessed Sonhood which is beyond the Holy Spirit. For
the Power in the midst of the Holy Spirit in the Boundary
of the Sonhood distributes the rushing and flowing concepts
to the Son of the Great Ruler.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
26. Therefore the Gospel came first from the Sonhood,
he says to the Ruler, through his Son who sits beside him,
and the Ruler learned that he was not the God of the
universals, but was a generated [being] and had above him
the outstretched Treasure-house of the Ineffable and Unnameable
God-who-was-Not and of the Sonhood.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> And he
was astounded and terrified when he perceived in what
ignorance he had been, and this, says [Basilides] is the
saying: “The fear of [the] Lord is the beginning of
wisdom.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> For he began to be wise when instructed by
the Christ seated beside him, and learned what was the
Non-Existent One, what the Sonhood, what the Holy
Spirit, and what was the constitution<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of the universals and
<span class="sidenote">p. 360.</span>
how these will be restored.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This is the wisdom spoken of
in mystery, as to which, says he, the Scripture declares:
“Not in the words taught by human wisdom, but in the
teachings of [the] Spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Then, says he, the Ruler when
he had been instructed and made to fear, confessed
thoroughly the sin he had committed in magnifying himself.
This, says he, is the saying: “I acknowledge my sin
and I know my transgression; upon this I will make full
confession for ever.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Now when the Great Ruler had been instructed, and
every creature of the Ogdoad had been taught and had
learned, and the mystery had been made known to those
above the heavens, it was still necessary that the Gospel
should come to the Hebdomad also, so that the Ruler of
the Hebdomad might be instructed in like manner and be
evangelized.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Son of the Great Ruler [therefore]
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
enlightened the Son of the Ruler of the Hebdomad, having
caught the light which he had from the Sonhood on high,
and the Son of the Ruler of the Hebdomad was enlightened,
and the Gospel was announced to the Ruler of the Hebdomad,
and he in like manner as has been said was both
terrified and made confession. When then all things in the
<span class="sidenote">p. 361.</span>
Hebdomad had been enlightened, and the Gospel had been
announced to them&mdash;for according to them, the creatures
belonging to these spaces are boundless and are Dominions
and Powers and Authorities, concerning whom they have
a very long story told by many [authors]. [And] they
imagine that there are there 365 heavens, and Habrasax is
their Great Ruler, because his name comprises the cipher
365, wherefore the year consists of that number of days<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;but
when, says he, these things had come to pass, it was
still necessary that our Formlessness should be enlightened
and that the mystery unknown to the earlier generations
should be revealed to the Sonhood left behind in the Formlessness
as if he were an abortion. As, says he, it is written:
“By revelation was made known to me the mystery;”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and
again, “I heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful
for man to utter.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> [Thus] the light came down from the
<span class="sidenote">p. 362.</span>
Hebdomad, which had come down from the Ogdoad on
high to the Son of the Hebdomad, upon Jesus the son of
Mary, and He, having caught it, was enlightened by the
light shining upon Him.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This, says he, is the saying:&mdash;“The
Holy Spirit shall come upon thee,” [that is], that
which passed from the Sonhood through the Boundary
Spirit into the Ogdoad and Hebdomad down to Mary, “and
the Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee,”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> [that is]
the power of the unction<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> from the Height of the Demiurge
on high unto the creation which is of the Son. But, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
says, up till that [time] the cosmos was thus constituted,
until [the time] when the whole Sonhood left behind in the
Formlessness to benefit souls and [itself] to receive benefits
should be transformed and follow Jesus, and should go on
high and come forth purified, and should become most
subtle as it might do by ascension like the First [Sonhood].
For it possesses all the power of attaching itself naturally to
the light which shines downward from on high.</p>

<p>27. When therefore, he says, every Sonhood shall have
come [forth] and shall be established above the Boundary
<span class="sidenote">p. 363.</span>
Spirit, the creation shall then receive pity. For up till now,
he says it wails and is tortured and awaits the revelation of
the sons of God, so that all the men of the Sonhood shall
ascend from this place. When this shall have come to pass,
he says, God shall bring upon the whole cosmos the Great
Ignorance, so that all things shall remain as they are by
nature, and none shall desire any of those things beyond
[its] nature. For all the souls of this space which possess
a nature enabling them to remain immortal in this [space]
alone, will remain convinced that there is nothing different
from nor better than this [space]. Nor will any tidings or
knowledge of higher things abide in those below, so that
the lower souls shall not be tormented by yearning after the
impossible, as if a fish should desire to feed with the sheep
on the hills. For, says he, such a desire should it happen
to them<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> would be [their] destruction. Therefore, he says,
all things which remain in their own place are imperishable;
but perishable if they wish to overleap and rise above [the
limits] of their nature. Thus the Ruler of the Hebdomad
will know nothing of the things above him. For the Great
<span class="sidenote">p. 364.</span>
Ignorance will lay hold of him, so that grief and pain and
sighing will stand off from him, for he will neither desire
anything impossible nor will he grieve. And in like manner
this Ignorance will lay hold of the Great Ruler of the
Ogdoad, and similarly all the creatures subject to him, so
that none of them shall grieve and mourn for anything
outside his own nature. And this shall be the Restoration
of all things established according to nature in the seed of
the universals at the beginning, but they shall be restored
[each] in their proper season. But [to prove] that everything
has its proper season, it is enough to mention the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
saying of the Saviour:&mdash;“Mine hour is not yet come”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and
the Magi observing the star. For, says [Basilides] He
himself was foretold by the nativity<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> of the stars and of the
return of the hours into the great heap. This is according
to them, the spiritual inner man conceived in the natural
man&mdash;which is the Sonhood who leaves the soul, not to die
but to remain as it is by nature, just as the first Sonhood<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 365.</span>
left the Holy Spirit which is the Boundary in its appropriate
place and then did on his own special soul.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In order that we may omit nothing of their [doctrines], I
will set forth what they say also about (a) Gospel.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Gospel
is according to them the knowledge of hypercosmic things,
as has been made plain, which the Great Ruler<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> did not
understand. When then there was manifested to him what
are the Holy Spirit that is the Boundary, and the Sonhood
and the God-who-is-Not the cause of all these, he rejoiced
at the words and exulted,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and this according to them is
the Gospel. But Jesus according to them was born as we
have before said. And He having come into being by the
Birth before explained, all those things likewise came to
pass with regard to the Saviour as it is written in the
Gospels. And these things came to pass [Basilides] says,
so that Jesus might become the first-fruits of the sorting-out
of the things of the Confusion.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> For when the Cosmos was
divided into an Ogdoad which is the head of the whole
ordered world, [the head whereof is] the Great Ruler, and
into a Hebdomad which is the head of the Hebdomad, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 366.</span>
Demiurge of the things below him, and into this space of
ours, which is the Formlessness, it was necessary that the
things of the Confusion should be sorted out by the
discrimination of Jesus.</p>

<p>That which was His bodily part<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which was from the
Formlessness, therefore suffered<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and returned to the Formlessness.
And that which was His psychic part which was
from the Hebdomad also returned to the Hebdomad. But
that which was peculiar to the Height of the Great Ruler
ascended and remained with the Great Ruler. And He
bore aloft as far as the Boundary Spirit that which was from
the Boundary Spirit and it remained with the Boundary
Spirit. But the third Sonhood which had been left behind
to give and receive benefits was purified by Him, and
traversing all these places went on high to the Blessed
Sonhood.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> For this is the whole theory,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as it were a Confusion
of the Seed-Mass and the discrimination [into classes]
and the Restoration of the things confused into their proper
places. Therefore Jesus became the first-fruits of the discrimination,
and the Passion came to pass for no other
reason than this discrimination.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> For in this manner, he
says, all the Sonhood left behind in the Formlessness to
<span class="sidenote">p. 367.</span>
give and receive benefits separated into its components in
the same way as [the person] of Jesus was separated. This
is what Basilides fables after having lingered in Egypt, and
having learned from them [of Egypt] such great wisdom, he
brought forth such fruits.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>28. And a certain Satornilus who flourished at the same
time as Basilides, but passed his life in Antioch of Syria,
taught the same things as Menander.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> He says that one
father exists unknown to all, who made Angels, Archangels,
Powers [and] Authorities. And that from a certain seven
angels the cosmos and all things therein came into being.
And that man was [the] creation of angels, there having
<span class="sidenote">p. 368.</span>
appeared on high from the Absolute One<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> a shining image
which they could not detain, says Saturnilus, because of its
immediate return on high. [Wherefore] they exhorted one
another, saying: “Let us make man according to image
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and resemblance.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Which, he says, having come to pass,
the image could not stand upright by reason of the lack of
power among the angels, but grovelled like a worm. Then
the Power on high having pity on it, because it had come
into being in his likeness, sent forth a spark of life which
raised up the man and made him live.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Therefore, says he,
the spark of life returns at death to its own kindred and the
rest of [man’s] compound parts is resolved into its original
elements.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> And he supposed the unknown Father<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to be
unbegotten, bodiless, and formless. But he says that He
showed Himself as a phantom in human shape, and that
the God of the Jews is one of the angels. And, because
the Father wished to depose all the angels, Christ came for
the putting-down of the God of the Jews and for the salvation
of those who believe on him; and that these [believers]
<span class="sidenote">p. 369.</span>
have the spark of life within them. For he says that two
races of men were formed by the angels, one bad and one
good. And that since the demons help the bad, the Saviour
came for the destruction of the bad men and demons, but
for the salvation of the good. And he says that to marry
and beget [children] is from Satan. Many of this man’s
adherents abstain from things that have had life, through
this pretended abstinence (leading astray many).<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And
they say that the Prophecies were uttered, some by the
world-creators, some by Satan whom he supposes to be an
angel who works against the world-creators and especially
(against) the God of the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Thus then Satornilus.</p>

29. Marcion of Pontus, much madder than these, passing
over many opinions of the majority and pressing on to the
more shameless, supposed that there were two principles of
the All,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> one good and the other bad. And he, thinking
that he was bringing in some new [doctrine], manufactured
a school filled with folly and of Cynic life, being himself
a lewd one.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> He thought that the multitude would not
notice that he chanced to be a disciple not of Christ, but
of Empedocles, who was very much earlier, and he laid
down and taught that there were two causes of the All,

that all the elements of which the cosmos was compounded

Water; two instruments, whereby the material elements
are arranged<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and changed about, [viz.] Fire and Air; and
two which work with the instruments and fashion matter,

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Zeus is fire and life-bearing Here the earth which bears
fruits for the support of life. But Aïdoneus is the air,
because while beholding all things through it, it alone we
do not see. And Nestis is water, since it is the only vehicle
of food, and therefore the becoming cause of all growing
things,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> yet cannot nourish them by itself. For if it could
so give nourishment, he says, living things<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> could never
die of hunger, for there is always abundance of water in
the cosmos.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Whence he calls water Nestis, because it is
a becoming cause of nourishment, yet cannot itself nourish
growing things. These things then are, to sum them up
in outline, those which comprise the foundation<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> of the
cosmos [<i>i. e.</i>] water and Earth from which all things come,
<span class="sidenote">p. 372.</span>
Fire and Spirit<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the tools and agents, and Strife and Love
which fashion all things with skill. And Love is a certain
peace and even mindedness and natural affection,<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> which
determines that the cosmos shall be perfect and complete;
but Strife ever rends asunder that which is one and divides
it and makes many things out of one. Therefore the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
cause of the whole creation is Strife, which [cause] he calls
baneful, that is deadly.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> For it takes care that through
every aeon, its creation persists. And Strife the deadly is
the Demiurge and maker of all things which have come
into being by birth; but Love, of their leading-forth from
the cosmos and transformation and return to unity.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Concerning
which, Empedocles [says] that there are two immortal
and unbegotten things which have never yet had
a source of existence. He speaks, however, somehow like
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For it was aforetime and will be; never, I ween,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">
<span class="sidenote">p. 373.</span>
But what are these two? Strife and Love. For they had
no source of existence, but pre-existed and ever were, being
through their unbegotten nature incorruptible. But Fire
[and Water] and Earth and Air die and again come to life.
For when the things which have come into being through
Strife die, Love takes them and leads them and adds and
attaches them to the All,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> so that the All may remain <i>One</i>,
being ever marshalled by Love in one fashion and form.
Yet when Love creates the One from many things, and
arranges the things which have been scattered in the One,
Strife again rends them away from the One, and makes
them [into] many, that is, Fire, Water, Earth [and] Air,
whence are produced animals and plants and whatever
parts of the cosmos we perceive. And concerning the
form<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of the cosmos as ordered by Love, he speaks somehow
like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

and again makes it [into] many. This is what Empedocles

troublous and unresting Demiurge of this cosmos, whose

</div>

<p class="noin">
<span class="sidenote">p. 377.</span>
This is the punishment wherewith the Demiurge punishes,
just as a smith forging iron, taking it from the fire, dips it
in water. For Fire is the aether, whence the Demiurge
casts the souls into the Sea; and the Earth is the ground.
Whence he says, from water to Earth, from Earth to Air.
This is what he says:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Each takes them from the other, but all hate them.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Therefore, according to Empedocles, Love gathers the
hated and tortured and punished souls together into this
world. For [Love] is good and has pity on their wailing
and the disorder and wickedness created by furious Strife.
And she hastens and toils to lead them forth quickly out
of the world and to settle them in the One, so that all
things brought together by her may come to oneness. It
<span class="sidenote">p. 378.</span>
is then by reason of this arrangement of this much-divided<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
world by deadly Strife, that Empedocles exhorts his disciples
to abstain from all things which have life. For he says
that the bodies of animals which are eaten are the dwellings
of punished souls, and he teaches those who hear such [his]
words to refrain<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> from companying with women, so that
they may not cooperate and help in the deeds which Strife
effects, ever undoing and rending asunder the work of
Love.</p>

<p>Empedocles says that this is the greatest law of the
government of the All, speaking somehow thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a thing of Necessity, an ancient decree of the gods.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternal and sealed with broad oaths.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
thus calling Necessity the change by Strife of the One into
many and that by Love of many into the One. He says,
indeed, that there are four mortal gods, Fire, Water, Earth
and Air; and two immortal unbegotten and enemies one
to the other for ever [viz.] Strife and Love; and that Strife
is ever unjust and grasping and rends asunder what belongs
<span class="sidenote">p. 379.</span>
to Love and takes it to itself; and that Love is ever
good and anxious for unity and calls back to herself and
leads and makes one the things rent asunder from the All
and tortured and punished in creation by the Demiurge.
In some such way does Empedocles philosophize for us on
the genesis of the Cosmos and its destruction and its
constitution established from good and evil.</p>

<p>And he says that there is a certain conceivable<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> third
power which may be conceived<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> from these, speaking

<p>30. When therefore Marcion or any of his dogs shall
bay against the Demiurge, bringing forward arguments from
the comparison of good and evil, they should be told that
neither the Apostle Paul nor Mark of the maimed finger<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
reported these things. For none of them is written in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Gospel [according] to Mark; [and] Marcion, having stolen
them from Empedocles of Agrigentum, the son of Meto,
thought until now to conceal the fact that he had taken
the whole arrangement of his heresy from Sicily, [after]
having transferred the actual words of Empedocles to the
Gospel discourses. For now, O Marcion, since you have
<span class="sidenote">p. 381.</span>
made antithesis<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of good and evil, I also to-day, following
up the teachings you have secretly borrowed<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> set them
over against [the originals]. Thou sayest that the Demiurge
of the cosmos is wicked.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Dost thou not then feel shame
in teaching to the Church the words of Empedocles? Thou
sayest that there is a good God who destroys the creations
of the Demiurge. Dost thou not then clearly preach as
good news<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> to thy hearers the good Love of Empedocles?
Thou dost forbid marriage and the begetting of children
and [dost order thy hearers] to abstain from the meats
which God has created for the participation of the faithful
and of those who know the truth,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> having purposely forgotten
that thou art teaching the purifications of Empedocles.
For, following him as you truly do throughout,
you teach your own disciples<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> to avoid meats, lest they
should eat some body covering a soul punished by the
Demiurge. You dissolve marriages joined by God, [thus]
following the teachings of Empedocles so that you may
preserve the work of Love undissevered. For marriage
according to Empedocles dissevers the One and creates
many as we have shown.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 382.</span>
31. The earliest and least altered<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> heresy of Marcion,
comprising the mingling of good and evil, has been shown
by us to be that of Empedocles. But since in our own time,
a certain Prepon the Assyrian,<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> a Marcionite, in a book
addressed to Bardesianes the Armenian, has undertaken
discourses on this heresy, I will not keep silence about
this either. Considering that there is a third principle, just
and set between good and evil, Prepon also does not thus
succeed in escaping the teaching of Empedocles. For
Empedocles says that the cosmos is governed by wicked
Strife, and the other conceivable [world] by Love, while
between the two opposed<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> principles is a just Logos, by
whom the things severed by Strife are brought together and
are attached by Love to the One. But this same just Logos,
<span class="sidenote">p. 383.</span>
who fights on the side of Love, Empedocles proclaims as
a Muse and invokes her to fight on his side, speaking
somehow thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If for creatures of a day, O deathless Muse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art pleased to relieve our cares by thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be propitious once more to my prayer, Calliope!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I show forth a pious discourse of [the] blessed gods.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Following this up, Marcion repudiates altogether our
Saviour’s Birth, thinking it out of the question that a
creature<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> of destructive Strife should become the Logos
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
fighting on the side of Love, that is of the Good. But he
said that without birth, in the 15th year of the reign of
Tiberius Cæsar, He came down from on high to teach in
the synagogues, being between evil and good. For if He is
<span class="sidenote">p. 384.</span>
a Mediator,<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> he says, He is freed from all nature of evil,
for evil, as he says, is the Demiurge and all his works. But
He was freed also, he says, from the nature of good, so that
He might be a Mediator, as Paul says,<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> which he himself
confessed [in the saying] “Why callest thou me good?
there is one Good.”</p>

<p>These then are Marcion’s doctrines, whereby he has
caused many to err by making use of the words of
Empedocles and transferring the philosophy stolen from
that person to his own teaching. [Thus] he has compounded
a godless heresy which I think has been sufficiently
refuted by us. Nor [do we think] that we have omitted
anything of those who, having stolen [opinions] from the
Greeks, insolently oppose the disciples of Christ, as if these
last had become their teachers of these things. But since
it seems to us that the opinions of this [Marcion] have been
sufficiently exposed,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> let us see what Carpocrates says.</p>

<div class="sidenote">p. 385.</div>
<h3 id="VII_4" title="4. Carpocrates.">
4. <i>Carpocrates.</i><a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></h3>

<p>32. Carpocrates says that the cosmos and the things
which are therein, came into being by angels much below
the unbegotten Father, but that Jesus was begotten by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Joseph and was born like other men, though more just than
the rest. And that His soul having been born strong and
pure remembered what it had seen in the sphere of the
unbegotten God;<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and that therefore a power was sent
down to it from that [Deity], so that by its means it might
escape from the world-making angels. And that this [soul]<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
having passed through them all and having been freed from
them went on high to the presence of the unbegotten
Father, and so will the souls<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> [go] who cleave to similar
things. And they say that the soul of Jesus, although
lawfully trained in Jewish customs, disdained them and
therefore received the powers whereby He made of none
effect<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> the passions attached to men for their punishment.
<span class="sidenote">p. 386.</span>
And that therefore the soul which like that of Christ can
disdain the world-making rulers, receives in the same way
power to do like things. Whence also they reach such [a
pitch of] vanity as to say they are like unto Jesus, and even
that they are mightier than man, and some of them more
excellent than His disciples, such as Peter and Paul and the
rest of the Apostles, and that they are in nothing behind
Jesus. But that their souls having come from the Transcendent
Authority<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and therefore similarly disdaining the
world-makers, are worthy of the same power [as He] and
will go to the same place. But that if anyone should
disdain more than He the things below, he might become
more excellent than He.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 387.</span>
They practise, then, magic arts, and incantations and [use]
philtres and love-feasts, and familiar spirits and dream-senders
and other evil works, thinking that they already
have authority to lord it over the rulers and makers of this
world, nay even over all created in it. Who have themselves
been sent forth by Satan for the dishonour<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> of the divine
name of the Church before the Gentiles, so that men
hearing in one way or another of their doctrines and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
thinking that we are all even as they, may turn away their
ears from the preaching of the Truth, [or] beholding their
deeds, may speak evil of us all.</p>

<p>And they consider that [their] souls will change their
bodies until they have fulfilled all their transgressions; but
that when nothing is left undone, they will be set free to
depart to the presence of the God who is above the world-making
angels, and that thus all souls will be saved. But
if any anticipating matters should combine all transgressions
<span class="sidenote">p. 388.</span>
in one advent,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> they will no longer change their bodies,
but as having paid all penalties at once, will be freed from
further birth in a body. Some of them also brand their
disciples in the back part of the lobe of the right ear. And
they make <a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> images of Christ saying that they were made
[in the time] of Pilate.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>


<h3 id="VII_5" title="5. Cerinthus.">5. <i>Cerinthus.</i><a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></h3>

<p>33. But a certain Cerinthus, having been trained in the
schooling of the Egyptians, said that the cosmos did not
come into being by the First God, but by a certain Power
derived from the Authority set over the universals, which is
yet ignorant of the God who is over all. And he supposed
Jesus not to have been begotten from a virgin, but to have
been born the son of Joseph and Mary like all other men,
<span class="sidenote">p. 389.</span>
and to have been more wise and just than they. And that,
at the Baptism, the Christ in the form of a dove descended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
upon Him from the Absolute Power<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> which is over the
universals. And that then He announced<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> the unknown
Father and perfected His own powers; but that in the end
the Christ stood away from Jesus, and Jesus suffered and
rose again;<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> but that the Christ being spiritual remained
impassible.</p>


<h3 id="VII_6" title="6. Ebionæi.">6. <i>Ebionæi.</i><a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></h3>

<p>34. But the Ebionæi admit that the cosmos came into
being by the God who is; and concerning Christ they
invent<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> the same things as Cerinthus and Carpocrates.
They live according to Jewish customs, thinking that they
will be justified by the Law and saying that Jesus was
justified in practising<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> the Law. Wherefore He was named
by God Christ and Jesus, since none of them has fulfilled
<span class="sidenote">p. 390.</span>
the Law. For if any other had practised the commandments
which are in the Law, he would be the Christ. And

<p>35. But a certain Byzantine named Theodotus brought
in a new heresy, asserting things about the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
All which partly agree with [the account of] the True
Church, since he admits that all things came into being by
God. But having taken<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> his [idea of] Christ from the
school of the Gnostics and from Cerinthus and Ebion,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> he
considers He appeared in some such fashion as this:&mdash;Jesus
was a man begotten from a virgin according to the Father’s
will, living the common life of all men. And having become
most pious,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> He at length on His baptism in Jordan
received the Christ from on high, who descended in the
<span class="sidenote">p. 391.</span>
form of a dove. Wherefore the powers within Him did not
become active, until the Spirit which came down was
manifested in Him, which [Spirit] declared Him to be the
Christ. But some will have it that He did not become God
on the descent of the Spirit; and others that [this took
place] on His resurrection from the dead.</p>

<p>36. But while different enquiries were taking place among
them<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> a certain man who was also called Theodotus, a
money-changer by trade, undertook to say that a certain
Melchizedek was the greatest power, and that he was greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
than Christ. After the image of whom they allege that
Christ happened [to come]. And they like the Theodotians
before mentioned say that Jesus was a man, and in the same
words [declare] that the Christ descended upon Him.</p>

But the opinions<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> of Gnostics are varied, and we do not
deem it worth while to recount in detail their foolish
doctrines, composed of much absurdity and charged with
blasphemy, the most respectable of which those Greeks who
philosophized on the Divine have refuted. But one cause
of the great conspiracy of these wicked ones was Nicolaus,
one of the seven appointed to the diaconate by the Apostles.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
He, having fallen away from the right doctrine, taught that
it was indifferent how men lived and ate: whose disciples
having waxed insolent, the Holy Spirit exposed in the
Apocalypse as fornicators and eaters of things offered to
idols.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>37. But a certain Cerdo taking in like manner his starting-point
from these [heretics] and from Simon, says that the
<span class="sidenote">p. 393.</span>
God announced by Moses and [the] Prophets was not the
Father of Jesus Christ. For that this God was known, but
the Father of the Christ unknowable; and that the first-named
was [only] just, but the other, good. The doctrine
of this [Cerdo] Marcion confirmed when he took in hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the <i>Antitheses</i><a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and everything which seemed to him to
speak against the Demiurge of all things. And so did
Lucian his disciple.</p>

<p>38. Now Apelles who [sprang] from among these men,
says thus:&mdash;There is a certain good God as Marcion supposed;
but he who created all things is [only] just; and
there is a third [God] who spoke to Moses, and yet a fourth,
a cause of evil. And he names these angels and speaks ill of
the Law and the Prophets, deeming the Scriptures of human
authorship and false. And he picks out of the Gospels
and Epistles the things favourable to him. Yet he clings
to the discourses of a certain Philumena as the manifestations<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 394.</span>
of a prophetess. And he says that the Christ came
down from the powers on high, <i>i. e.</i> from the Good One and
was the son of that One, and was not begotten from a virgin,
nor did He appear bodiless;<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> but that taking parts from
every substance<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> of the All, He made a body, that is from
hot and cold and wet and dry. And that in this body He
lived unnoticed by the cosmic authorities during the time
that He spent in the cosmos. And moreover that having
been crucified<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> by the Jews He died, and after three days
rose again and appeared to the disciples showing the marks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of the nails and [the wound] in his side, and thereby convinced
them that He existed and was not a phantom but
was incarnate. The flesh [Apelles] says, which He showed,
He gave back to the earth whence was its substance, and
He desired nothing of others, but merely used [the flesh]
for a season. He gave back to each its own, having loosed
again the bond of the body, <i>i. e.</i> the hot to the hot, the cold
to the cold, the wet to the wet and the dry to the dry,<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and
thus passed to the presence of the good Father, leaving the
seed of life to the world to those who believe through the
disciples.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 395.</span>
39. It seems to us that we have set forth sufficiently these
things also. But since we have decided to leave unrefuted
no doctrines taught by any [heretic], let us see what has
been excogitated by the Docetae.</p>


<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_293" href="#FNanchor_293" class="label">[1]</a> Of the Basilides with whose doctrines this book opens, little is
known. While some would on slender grounds make him a Syrian,
there is no doubt that he taught in Egypt and especially in Alexandria,
where he seems to have steeped himself in Greek philosophy. This
must have been during the reign of Hadrian and some time before the
appearance of the far greater heresiarch Valentinus. If we could
believe the testimony of Epiphanius, Basilides was a fellow-disciple with
Satornilus, to be presently mentioned, of Menander, the immediate
successor of Simon Magus; and, according to the more trustworthy
witness of Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom.</i>, VII, 17), he himself claimed
to be the disciple of Glaucias, “the interpreter” of St. Peter. He had
a son Isidore who shared his teaching, and he wrote a treatise in
twenty-four books on the Gospels which he called <i>Exegetica</i>. The
sect that he founded, although never popular, lingered for some time
in Egypt; but there is much probability in Matter’s conjecture (<i>Hist.
crit. du Gnost.</i>, 2nd ed., III, 36), that most of his followers became
the hearers of Valentinus.</p>

<p>Our author’s account of Basilides’ doctrine at first sight differs so
widely from that given by Irenæus and his copyists that it was for long
supposed that the two accounts were irreconcilable. The late Prof.
Hort, however, in his lucid article on the subject in the <i>Dictionary
of Christian Biography</i> showed with much skill that this was not so,
and that the Basilidian doctrine contained in our text is in all probability
that of the <i>Exegetica</i> itself, while the teaching attributed to
Basilides by Irenæus and others was the same doctrine largely corrupted
by the inconsistent and incoherent superstitions which invariably
attach themselves to any faith propagated in secret. The immediate
source of Basilides’ own teaching cannot, up to the present time, be
satisfactorily traced; but, although its coping-stone, the non-existent
Deity, shows some likeness to the Buddhistic ideas which were at
any rate known in the Alexandria of his time (Clem. Alex., <i>Strom.</i>, I,
15), it is probable that among the relics of the ancient Egyptian
religion, then almost extinct, something of the same idea might have
been found. His obligation to the Stoic philosophy is well brought
out by Hort; and he was doubtless versed in the dialectical methods
of Aristotle, which, then as later, formed the universal equipment of
the student of philosophy. Hippolytus’ theory that the ground-work
of the Basilidian edifice is a conscious or unconscious borrowing from
Aristotle derives no support from any Aristotelian writings known to
us. Unlike other Gnostics, Basilides displays no animus towards the
Jews beyond reducing their Deity to the Ruler of the Hebdomad, or
lowest spiritual world, and he accepts as fully as possible the Divinity
of Jesus and the authority of the New Testament. Of the Docetism
attributed to him by Irenæus and others, there is here no trace, and
the Bishop of Lyons’ statement on this point can only be explained by
supposing that he here confused Basilides with some other heresiarch.</p>

<p>The distinctive features of Basilides’ teaching as disclosed in our
text are, however, plain enough. Rejecting all idea of a pre-existing
matter, he derives everything from the Supreme Being, whom he considers
to be so unspeakably and inconceivably great that he will not
even say of Him that He exists. He it is who from the first decreed
not only the foundation of the universe but also the means and agency
by which this is to be brought about. Nor do the apparent defects in
its constitution involve in Basilides’ system any thwarting of the Divine
Will by intermediate agents, or any lapse from duty on their part. All
things subsequent to the Supreme Being are in effect His children, and
from the Panspermia or Seed-Mass originally let fall by Him emerges
the First Sonhood, or purest part of the Sonhood, which, rising from
the heap by its own lightness and tenuity, springs upward into the
presence of the First Cause, where it remains for the purpose of giving
light when needed to the lower parts of creation. This is quickly
followed by the Second Sonhood (or Second Part of the Sonhood),
which, emerging in like manner, rises not from its own unaided power,
but with the assistance of the Boundary Spirit, who must have its
origin in the Seed-Mass, and who is left as the Boundary between the
visible and the invisible part of the universe when the Second Sonhood
passes to the Ogdoad or Eighth Heaven. This Eighth Heaven is under
the sway of the Great Ruler, a functionary emitted by the Seed-Mass
for the purpose of governing this abode of perfection, from which it
may be inferred that the Second Sonhood like the First ultimately
returns to the presence of the Supreme Being. In his organization of
this Eighth Heaven, the Great Ruler is much helped by the Son whom
he calls forth from the Seed-Mass, who is expressly stated to be greater
and wiser than his own Father.</p>

<p>There remains in the Seed-Mass two other world-creating powers.
The first of these is the maker of the Seven Heavens or Hebdomad, which
can here hardly be the planets, because they are expressly said to be
sublunary. He, too, produces from the Seed-Mass a Son greater and
wiser than himself, who again, it may be supposed, assists his father in
the organization of this Hebdomad. What form this organization
took we are not told, although there is some talk of 365 beings who
are all “Dominions and Powers and Authorities” with a ruler called
Habrasax. Below this Hebdomad, however, comes this world of ours
called the “Formlessness,” which has, it is said, “no leader nor
guardian nor demiurge” (<i>i. e.</i> architect), everything happening in it as
decreed by the Supreme Being from the first. Yet this Formlessness
contains within it the Third Sonhood (or third part of the Sonhood)
whose mission is apparently to guide the souls of men to the place for
which they are predestined, which it does by imparting to them some
of its own nature. Then, when the time came for the Coming of the
Saviour, a light shining from the highest heavens was transmitted
through the intermediate places to the Son of the Hebdomad and fell
upon “Jesus the son of Mary,” and He after the Passion ascended like
the two first parts of the Sonhood to the Divine Presence. In due time
the third part of the Sonhood will, it is said, follow Him. When this
happens, the soul predestined to the Seven Heavens will pass thither,
those more enlightened will be admitted to the Eighth Heaven, and
those entitled to the most glorious destiny of all will probably ascend
with the third part of the Sonhood to the Highest. On the two
inferior classes, there will then fall the “Great Ignorance,” a merciful
oblivion which will prevent them from remembering or otherwise being
troubled in their beatitude by the knowledge of the still better things
above them.</p>

<p>How the salvation of these souls is to be effected there is no indication
in Hippolytus, and he leaves us in entire doubt as to whether
Basilides allowed any free-will to man in the matter. It is probable
that he taught the doctrine of transmigration as a means of purification
from sins or faults committed in ignorance. But it is several times
asserted that he looked on suffering as a cleansing process for the soul,
and that he did not admit the existence of evil (see Hort’s article on
Basilides in <i>D.C.B.</i>, I, pp. 274, 275 for references). About some of
his teaching there was deliberate concealment (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 279), and
Irenæus (I, xxiv. 6), tells us that his followers were taught to declare
that while they were “no longer Jews” they were “not yet” (or
perhaps “more than”) Christians. In this we may perhaps see the
influence of the rubrics of the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i>, and the
beginning of that secret propagation of religion which was to find
its ripest fruit in Manichæism. For the rest, although Irenæus
(I, xxiv. 5) tells us that Basilides, like Simon, Valentinus, and other
Gnostics, taught that the body of Jesus was a phantasm, and even that
Simon of Cyrene had been crucified in His stead, there appears no
trace of this in our text, and it is possible that the Bishop of Lyons is
here again confusing Basilides’ doctrines with those of his successors.</p>

within the Panspermia was concealed a germ which was more closely

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_394" href="#FNanchor_394" class="label">[102]</a> As has been said, there appears no reason to doubt that Hippolytus
took his account of Basilides’ doctrines directly from the works of that
heresiarch or of his son Isidore. The likeness of the quotations from
Basilides or “those about Basilides” in Clement of Alexandria&mdash;a far
more accurate and critical writer than Hippolytus&mdash;to our text leave no
doubt on this point, and it is even probable that, as Hort thought, most
of Hippolytus’ information is gathered from Basilides’ <i>Exegetica</i>. His
account of the universe and its creation is largely Stoic, as may be seen
by a comparison of this chapter with that on the Universe in Prof.
E. V. Arnold’s excellent <i>Roman Stoicism</i> (Cambridge, 1911); but he
differs from all the Pagan philosophy of his time by his view of matter
which he makes neither pre-existent nor malignant. In this, and in
the “happy ending” to his drama of the universe, we may perhaps
see the result of the Golden Age of the Antonines, and it is to this,
perhaps, that he owed the influence that he, without any great followers
or successors, had upon the future theology of orthodox and heretic
alike. Many of his ideas, and even a few of his very words, appear in
documents like the later parts of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, and in certain
Manichæan writings, although the strict monotheism which distinguishes
them is in sharp contrast with the dualism of his successors. This
begets a doubt whether these last were conscious borrowers of his
opinion, or whether both he and they took their doctrines from some
common source of Eastern tradition not now recognizable; but on the
whole, the first-named hypothesis seems the more probable.</p>

I, 3, spell the name. Iren., I, 22; Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i>, IV, 7, and later
writers spell it Σατορνῖνος. All these accounts, however, together with
that in our text, are in effect copies of the chapter in Iren., which is
the earliest in time that has remained to us. Salmon in <i>D.C.B.</i>, s.v.
“Saturninus,” thinks that this last is itself copied from Justin Martyr,
which is likely enough, but remains without proof.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_396" href="#FNanchor_396" class="label">[104]</a> Epiphanius, <i>Haer.</i> XXIII, p. 124, Oehl. adds to this that Saturninus
and Basilides were co-disciples, which, if true, would connect their
systems with Menander’s teacher, Simon Magus. Nothing further
is, however, known about Saturnilus or Saturninus or his heresy, which
Epiphanius makes the third after Christ, nor is there any mention in
any of the heresiologies of any writings by him. His story of a First
or Pattern Man made in the image of the Supreme Being is common,
as has been said, to many of the early heresies, and reappears in
Manichæism. It is probably to be referred to some tradition current in
Western Asia. See Bousset’s <i>Hauptprobleme der Gnosis</i>, cap. “Der
Urmensch.”</p>

chief of the seven powers. Epiphanius adds to it that the world-makers
divided the cosmos among them by lot, and that it was a spark of his
own Power that the “Power on high” sent down for the vivification of
the First Man, “which spark, he says, they fancy to be the human
soul.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_404" href="#FNanchor_404" class="label">[112]</a> Marcion of Pontus was the heresiarch most dreaded by the Ante-Nicene
Fathers, and is said to have led away from the Primitive Church
a greater number of adherents than any teacher of that age, with the
doubtful exception of Valentinus. He also differed from all other
heretics of the time in setting up a Church fully equipped with bishops,
priests, and deacons over against the Catholic, and in seeing that his
followers openly avowed their faith in times of persecution. He rejected
the Old Testament entirely, and reduced the New to a shorter edition
of the Gospel of St. Luke and ten of the Epistles of St. Paul. This
has led to his heresy receiving more attention than any other of its contemporaries
at the hands of modern scholars, especially in Germany.
Hence it is to be regretted that the chapter in our text which is devoted
to him adds nothing to our knowledge of his history or tenets, while
its statement that Marcion called the Demiurge πονηρός (wicked) shows
either that Hippolytus was ignorant of Marcion’s opinions, or that he
misread his authority. The first is the more likely theory, as his master
Irenæus gives a more scanty account of Marcion than of any other
heretic, while promising to write a special treatise against him. This
intention does not seem to have been carried out, and it is probable
that while the Marcionite heresy flourished at an early date in the
Eastern provinces of the Empire, it had too slight a hold in the West
to have given such writers as Irenæus and Hippolytus much first-hand
knowledge concerning it. It is also noted that in the so-called
“epitome of heresies” in Book X, Hippolytus does not, after his
manner with the other heresies, quote from this chapter.</p>

There is nothing in the quotations here given from Empedocles to show
that that philosopher made Love and Strife the two ἀρχαί of the
universe, as Empedocles associates with them the four “elements” of
Fire, Earth, Water and Air, and Ἀνάγκη or Fate seems, according to
his teaching, to be superior to them all. The quotations prove, however,
that Empedocles taught metempsychosis, unless Hippolytus is here confusing
him with Pythagoras. Marcion did not, and the reason that he
gave for abstinence from animal food is different from that attributed
to Empedocles. The quotations themselves are much corrupted, and
Hippolytus seems to have taken them from memory only, as he is
careful to say that these are “something like this.” All of them
appear in Karsten’s or Stein’s collections, which were made before
the discovery of our text, and are, therefore, an argument against
Salmon’s theory of forgery.</p>

him admit the independent existence of a third principle in the shape
of malignant matter. For this, see <i>Forerunners</i>, II, p. 217, n. 2.</p>

Photius. With the exception of the notice of Prepon, our text contains

they have come down to us, and his followers were probably few. They
are accused by Irenæus, from whose chapter on the subject Hippolytus’
account is condensed, of a kind of Antinomianism having its origin in
the contention that all actions are indifferent.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_465" href="#FNanchor_465" class="label">[173]</a> This chapter is in effect a condensation of Irenæus I, xx, which it
follows closely. Hippolytus omits mention of the obscenities attributed
to the sect which are hinted at by Irenæus and described fully by
Epiphanius. Irenæus also mentions that they claimed to get their
doctrine from the secret teaching of Jesus to the Apostles, that one
Marcellina taught their heresy in Rome under Pope Anicetus, and that
the images of Christ were worshipped by them, <i>more Gentilium</i>, along
with those of Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Epiphanius derives
the heresy from Simon Magus. It is suggested that the branding by
which they knew each other was due to a “baptism by fire.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_466" href="#FNanchor_466" class="label">[174]</a> This chapter also is practically identical with Irenæus I, xxi, which

Gnostics and tradition makes him contemporary with St. John. He
was probably a member of the Jewish-Alexandrian school of Philo, and
Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> XXVIII) adds to Irenæus’ account that he taught in
Asia, and especially in Galatia.</p>

followers of a mythical leader Ebion. The existence of any founder of
this name is now generally given up, and the word is more probably a
mere transliteration of the Hebrew אביון, “poor.” The Ebionites
were in all likelihood Judaizing Christians who had remained behind in
Palestine through the wars of Titus and Hadrian, and still kept to the
observance of the Mosaic Law. The brief statement in our text is
probably derived from Hippolytus’ recollection of Irenæus, I, c. 21,
the first sentence being in nearly the same words in both authors.
Irenæus adds to it that they used the gospel of St. Matthew only and
did not consider St. Paul as an apostle, because he did not keep the
Law; also that they adored Jerusalem as the “house of God.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_473" href="#FNanchor_473" class="label">[181]</a> In the accounts of the two Theodoti, which may here be taken
together, Hippolytus leaves Irenæus, from whom he has hitherto been
content to copy his account of the smaller heresies, and draws from some
source not yet identified, but which may be the <i>Little Labyrinth</i> of Caius
(see Salmon in <i>D.C.B.</i>, s.v. “Theodotus.”). His description of the
heresy of Theodotus of Byzantium corresponds with that of Eusebius
(<i>Eccl. Hist.</i>, V, 28). The Melchizedekian theory of the “other”
Theodotus is mentioned by Philaster (c. 53, p. 54, Oehl.) without
reference to Theodotus, although on the preceding page he has given
the Byzantine heresy as in our text. Pseudo-Tertullian in <i>Adv. Omn.
Haer.</i> (II, p. 764, Oehl.) gives the story of both Theodoti much as here,
which may give support to the theory that this tract is a summary
of the lost <i>Syntagma</i> of Hippolytus. Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> XXXIV,
XXXV) divides the Melchizedekians from the Theodotians, and says
the first were ἀποσπασθέντες from the second, but without naming the
banker. He also gives some particulars about the first Theodotus,
which he does not seem to have taken from Hippolytus. He quotes
one Hierax as saying that Melchizedek was the Holy Spirit, and
says that “some” say that Heracles was his father and Astaroth or
Asteria his mother, while Melchizedek plays a great part in the earliest
part of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> as the “Receiver of the Light.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_481" href="#FNanchor_481" class="label">[189]</a> This Cerdo is only known to us as a predecessor of Marcion, whose
teaching he appears to have influenced, although in what measure
cannot now be ascertained. His date seems to be fairly well settled as
about the year 135 (see <i>D.C.B.</i>, s.h.v.), which is that of his coming
to Rome, and it was doubtless here that Marcion met him. According
to Irenæus, his teaching was mainly in secret and he was always ready
to make submission to the Church and recant his errors when publicly
arraigned. His doctrine, so far as it has come down to us, does not
seem to differ from that of Marcion, Tertullian (<i>adv. Marcion</i>) and the
tractate <i>Adv. Omn. Haer.</i> giving the best account of it. Of Lucian,
we know nothing, save that, while Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> XLII, p. 688,
Oehl.) makes him out the immediate successor of Marcion and to have
been succeeded by Apelles, Tertullian (<i>de Resurrectione</i>, c. 2) speaks
of him&mdash;if he be the person there referred to as Lucanus&mdash;as an independent
teacher with no apparent connection with Marcion’s heresy.
He adds that he taught a resurrection neither of the body nor of the
soul, but of some part of man which he calls a “third nature.” See
<i>Forerunners</i>, II, p. 218, n. 2, and 220.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_483" href="#FNanchor_483" class="label">[191]</a> Of this Apelles, our knowledge is mainly derived from Tertullian,
for references to whom see Hort’s article “Apelles” in <i>D.C.B.</i> He
was certainly later than Marcion, for Rhodo (see Euseb., <i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, V,
c. 13), writing at the end of the second century, A.D., speaks of him as
still alive, though an “old man.” The same author seems to consider
that on Marcion’s death he founded a sect of his own, in which he
“corrected” Marcion’s teaching in some particulars. This is doubtful,
but Rhodo’s statements go to show that he quoted from the Old
Testament and did not hold the body of Jesus to be a phantasm.
Tertullian also mentions several times the connection of Apelles with
the “possessed” Philumene, on which he puts a construction negatived
by the evidence of Rhodo. Cf. <i>Forerunners</i>, II, pp. 218-220.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_484" href="#FNanchor_484" class="label">[192]</a> Hippolytus here accepts the statement of Tertullian (<i>de Præscript.</i>,

containing the prophecies of Philumene. He repeats this with more
distinctness in <a href="#Book_X">Book X</a>, c. 20, <i>q. v.</i></p>

of that author’s works in Oehler’s edition. No other author mentions
Apelles with such particularity, and all those subsequent to Tertullian
appear to have taken their information either from Tertullian’s other
works, from this tractate, or from our text. This tractate has been
discussed in the Introduction (see Vol. I, pp. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_12">12</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_23">23</a> <i>supra</i>) and
perhaps all difficulties may be solved by supposing it to be, not indeed
the actual <i>Syntagma</i> of Hippolytus, but a summary of it.</p>

<h3 id="VIII_1">1. <i>The Docetae.</i></h3>

<p>8. Since the many, making no use of the Lord’s counsel,
while having the beam<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in their eye, yet give out that they
can see, it seems to us that we should not be silent as to
their doctrines. So that they, being brought to shame by
our forthcoming refutation, shall recognize how the Saviour
counselled them to take away the beam from their own eye,
and then to see clearly the straw which was in their brother’s
eye. Now, therefore, having set forth sufficiently and
adequately the opinions of most of the heretics in the seven
books before this, we shall not now be silent upon those
which follow. Exhibiting the ungrudging grace of the
Holy Spirit, we shall also refute those who seem to have
<span class="sidenote">p. 398.</span>
attained security, They call themselves Docetae and teach
thus:&mdash;The first God<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is as it were the seed of a fig, in size
altogether of the smallest, but in power boundless, a magnitude
unreckoned in quantity, lacking nothing for bringing
forth, a refuge for the fearful, a covering for the naked, or
veil for shame, a fruit sought for, whereto, he says, the
Seeker came thrice and found not.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Wherefore, he says,
He cursed the fig-tree,<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> so that that sweet fruit was not found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
on it, [<i>i. e.</i>] the fruit that was sought for. And [the seed]
being, so to speak briefly, of such a nature and so old [yet]
small and without magnitude, the cosmos came into being
from God, as they think, in some such way as this:&mdash;The
branches of the tree becoming tender, put forth leaves, as
is seen, and fruit follows, wherein is preserved the innumerable
<span class="sidenote">p. 399.</span>
[and] stored-up seed of the fig. We think, therefore,
that three things first come into being from the seed of the
fig, the stem which is the fig-tree, leaves, and the fruit or
fig, as we have before said. Thus, says he, three Aeons
came into being as principles from the First Principle of the
universals.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And on this, he says, Moses was not silent,
when he said that the words of God were three: “Darkness,
cloud and whirlwind and he added no more.”<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For, he
says, God added nothing to the Three Aeons, but they
sufficed and do suffice for all things which come into being.
But God Himself abides by Himself and far removed from
all the Aeons.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, each of these Aeons, he says, had
received a principle of generation, as has been said, it
little by little increased and grew great and became
perfect. Now they think that the perfect number [is] ten.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Then the Aeons having come into being equal in number
and perfection, as they think, they were thirty Aeons in
all,<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> each of them being complete in a decad. But they
are divided and the three having equal honour among themselves,
differ in position only, because one of them is first,
<span class="sidenote">p. 400.</span>
another second, and another third. But this position
produced a difference of power. For he who is nearest to
the First God&mdash;to the seed as it were&mdash;chances to have
a power more fruitful than the others, he who is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Immeasureable One having measured himself ten times
in magnitude. And the Incomprehensible One, who has
become second in position to the first, comprehended
himself six times. And the third in position, becoming
removed to an infinite distance by reason of his brethren’s
dilatation, conceived<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> himself three times and, as it were,
bound himself by a certain eternal bond of unity.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>9. And this they think is the Saviour’s saying:&mdash;“The
sower went forth to sow and that which fell upon good
and fair ground made some 100, some 60, and some 30.”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
And hence, says he, He said, “He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear,” because this is not what all understand.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
All these Aeons [to wit] the Three and all the boundlessly
boundless ones [who come] from them, are masculo-feminine
ones.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Therefore having increased and become great, and
all of them being from that one first seed of their concord
<span class="sidenote">p. 401.</span>
and unity, and all becoming together one Aeon, they all
begat from the one Virgin Mary, the begettal common to
them all, a Saviour in the midst of them all,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of equal
power in everything with the seed of the fig, save that He
was begotten. But that first seed whence is born the fig
is unbegotten. Then those three Aeons having been
adorned<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with all virtue and holiness, as these teachers
think, all the conceivable, lacking-nothing, nature of that
Only-Begotten<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Son&mdash;for He alone was born to the boundless
Aeons by a triple generation; for three immeasureable
Aeons with one mind begot Him&mdash;was adorned also. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
all these conceivable and eternal things were Light; but
the Light was not formless and idle, nor did it lack anything
superadded to it: but it contained within itself the
boundless forms of the various animals here below corresponding
in number to the boundlessly boundless after the
pattern of the fig-tree. And it shone from on high into
<span class="sidenote">p. 402.</span>
the underlying chaos. And this [chaos], being at once
illuminated and given form from the various forms on
high, received consistence<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and took all the supernal forms
from the Third Aeon who had tripled himself.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But this
Third Aeon, seeing all the types<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that were his at once
intercepted in the underlying darkness beneath, and not
being ignorant of the power of the darkness and the simplicity
and generosity<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of the light, would not allow the
shining types from on high to be drawn far down by the
darkness beneath. But he subjected [the Firmament] to
the Aeons. Then, having fixed it below, he divided in
twain the darkness and the light.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> “And he called the
light which is above the firmament, Day, and the darkness
he called Night.”<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Therefore, as I have said, when all the
boundless forms of the Third Aeon were intercepted in this
lowest darkness, and the impress<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of that same Aeon was
stamped upon it along with the rest, a living fire came
from the light whence the Great Ruler came into being
<span class="sidenote">p. 403.</span>
of whom Moses says: “In the beginning God created
Heaven and Earth.”<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Moses says that this fiery God<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
spoke from the bush, that is from the darksome air, for
<i>batos</i> [bush] is the whole air which underlies the darkness.
But it is <i>batos</i>, says Moses according to him, because all
the forms of light go from on high downwards, having the
air as a passage.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And the word from the bush is no less
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
recognized by us. For a sound significant of speech is
reverberating air, without which human speech could not
be recognized. And not only does our word from the
bush, that is from the air, make laws for and be a fellow-citizen
with us, but also odours and colours manifest their
powers to us through the air.</p>

<p>10. Then this fiery God&mdash;the fire born from the light&mdash;made
the cosmos, as Moses says, in this manner, he being
substanceless,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> [and] darkness having the substance and
being ever silent towards the eternal types of the light
which are intercepted below.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Therefore, until the Saviour’s
manifestation, there was a certain great wandering of souls
by reason of the God of the Light, the fiery Demiurge.
For the forms are called souls, having been cooled down<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
from the things above and they continue in darkness to
change about from body to body under the supervision of
<span class="sidenote">p. 404.</span>
the Demiurge. And that this is so, we may know from
the words of Job: “And I also am a wanderer from place
to place and from house to house.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Saviour also
says: “And if you will receive it, this is the Elias who
shall come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
But by the Saviour, change of bodies has been made to
cease; and faith is preached for the putting-away of transgressions.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In some such way that Only-Begotten Son
beholding from on high the forms of the Aeons changing
about in the darksome bodies willed to come down for
their deliverance. When He saw that the multitude of
Aeons could not bear to behold without ceasing the
Pleroma of all the Aeons, but remained as mortals dreading
corruption,<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> being held by the greatness and glory of
power, He drew Himself together as a very great flash in
a very small body, or rather, like the light of the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
drawn together under the eyelids, and goes forth to the
<span class="sidenote">p. 405.</span>
heaven and the shining stars. And there He again withdraws
Himself under the eyelids at His pleasure. Thus
does the light of the eye, and although it is everywhere
present and is all things to us, it is invisible; but we see
only the lids of the eye, the white corners, a broad membrane
of many folds and fibres, a horn-like coat, and under
this a berry-like pupil, both net-like and disk-like, and if
there are any other coats to the light of the eye, it is
enwrapped and lies hidden within them.</p>

<p>Thus, he says, the Only-Begotten Son, eternal on high,
did on Himself (a form) corresponding to each Aeon of
the Three Aeons, and being in the triacontad of Aeons,
came into the world of the Decad<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> being of such age
and as little as we have said, invisible, unknown, without
glory and not believed upon. in order then, say the
Docetae,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that he might do on also the Outer Darkness
which is the flesh, an angel came down with Him from
<span class="sidenote">p. 406.</span>
on high and made announcement<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> to Mary as it is written,
and He was born from her as it is written. And He who
came from on high put on that which was born, and did
all things as it is written in the Gospels; and was baptized
in Jordan. And he was baptized, receiving the type and
seal in the water of the body born from the Virgin, in
order that when the Ruler should condemn the form which
was his to death, to the Cross, that soul which had grown
up within the body should strip off that body and affix it
to the Tree. And thus (the soul) having triumphed by its
means over the Principles and Authorities would not be
found naked, but would put on that body reflected in the
likeness of that flesh in the water when He was baptized.
This he says, is the Saviour’s saying: “Unless a man be
born of water and of [the] Spirit, he shall not enter into
the kingdom of the heavens; because that which is born
of the flesh is flesh.”<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>From the thirty Aeons, then, He did on thirty forms.
Wherefore that Eternal One was thirty years on the earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
every Aeon being manifested in his own year. And souls
are all the forms which have been intercepted from each of
<span class="sidenote">p. 407.</span>
the thirty Aeons, and each of them possesses a nature
capable of understanding the Jesus who exists according to
nature which that Only-Begotten One from the eternal
places puts on. But these places are different. Therefore
so many heresies contending [with each other] about it,
seek Jesus. And He is claimed<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by them all, but is seen
differently by each from the different places. Towards
whom, he says, each [soul] is borne and hurries, thinking
that she is alone. Who is indeed her kinsman and fellow-citizen.
Whom she beholding for the first time recognizes
as her own brother and all the rest as bastards. Those then
who have their nature from the lower places cannot see
the forms of the Saviour above them. But those on high,
he say, from the middle Decad and the most excellent
Ogdoad<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>&mdash;whence, say they, we are&mdash;know Jesus the
Saviour not in part but wholly, and are alone the Perfect
from above, while the others are only partly so.</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 408.</span>
11. I think then that this is for right-thinking persons
sufficient for the knowledge of the complicated and inconsistent
heresy of the Docetae&mdash;those who attempt to make
arguments about inaccessible and incomprehensible matter
calling themselves thus. Certain of whom do not only <i>seem</i><a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
to be mad; and we have proved that the beam from such
matter has entered their own eye, if they are anyhow able
to see clearly; and, if not, they will be unable to blind
others. Whose dogma the early sophists of Greece anticipated
in many points of sophistry, as our readers will understand.
These then are the teachings of the Docetae.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It seems
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
right also that we should not keep silence as to the
[teachings] of Monoimus.</p>


<h3 id="VIII_2">2. <i>Monoimus.</i></h3>

<p>12. Monoimus the Arab<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> was a long way off<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the glory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of the great-voiced poet; for he thinks that some such man
as Oceanus existed, of whom the poet speaks somehow like
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="indent0"><span class="sidenote">p. 409.</span><span class="verse">Oceanus, the birth of gods and birth of man.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning this into other words, he says that a Man is the
All which is the source of the universals, [being] unbegotten,
incorruptible, and eternal; and that there is a Son of the
aforesaid Man, who is begotten, and capable of suffering,
being born in a timeless, unwilled, and previously undefined
way. For such, says he, is the Power of that Man. And
when it was so, the son of the Power came into being more
quickly than reasoning or counsel. And this is, he says,
the saying in the Scriptures: “He was and came into
being,”<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which is: Man was and his son came into being,
as if one were to say: Fire was and Light came into being
in a timeless, unwilled, and previously undefined way, while
being at the same time fire. But this Man is a single
monad, uncompounded [and] undifferentiated, [and yet]
compounded [and] differentiated, loving and at peace with
all things, [and yet] fighting with and at war with all things
before him,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> unlike and like, as it were a certain musical
<span class="sidenote">p. 410.</span>
harmony which contains whatever one may say or leave
unsaid, showing all things and giving birth to all things.
“This is Father, this is Mother, Two Immortal names.”<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
But for the sake of an instance, conceive, he says, as the
greatest image of the Perfect Man, the one tittle which is
one tittle uncompounded, simple, a pure monad having no
composition whatever from anything, [yet] compounded of
many forms, of many parts. That undivided One, he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
is the many-faced and myriad-eyed and myriad-named one
tittle of the Iota,<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which is an image of that Perfect and
Invisible Man.</p>

<p>13. The one tittle, he says, is then the monad and a
decad. For by this power of the one tittle of the Iota
[are produced] also [the] dyad and triad and tetrad and
pentad and hexad and heptad and ogdoad and ennead
up to the ten. For these are the diversified numbers
dwelling within that simple and uncompounded tittle of the
<span class="sidenote">p. 411.</span>
Iota. And this is the saying:&mdash;“Because it pleased the
whole Pleroma to dwell within the Son of Man bodily.”<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
For such compounds of numbers from the simple and uncompounded
one tittle of the Iota become he says bodily
hypostases. Therefore, he says, the Son of Man was born
from the Perfect Man, whom none know. But, he says,
every creature who is ignorant of the Son, represents Him
as the offspring of a woman. Of which Son some shadowy
rays come very close to this world and secure and control
change [of bodies and] birth. And the beauty of that Son
of Man is till now unrevealed to all men who are misled as
to the offspring of a woman. Nothing then of the things
here come into being, he says, from that Man, nor will they
ever do so; but all things that have come into being have
done so not from the whole, but from some part of the Son
of Man. For, says he, the Son of Man is one Iota, one
tittle flowing from on high, full, and filling full all things,
and containing within itself whatever the Man, Father of
the Son of Man possesses.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 412.</span>
14. Now the cosmos, as Moses says, came into being in
six days, that is, in six powers which are in the one tittle of
the Iota.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> [But] the seventh, a rest and a Sabbath, came
into being from the Hebdomad which is over Earth and
Water and Fire and Air, out of which the cosmos came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
into being by the one tittle. For the cubes and the octahedrons,
and [the] pyramids and all the figures like these of
which Fire, Air, Water, [and earth] consist, came into being
from the numbers which are comprised in that single tittle
of the Iota, which is a Perfect Son of a Perfect Man. When
then, says he, Moses says that (the) rod was turned about in
different ways for the plagues on Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> these [plagues], he
says, are symbols allegorizing the Creation. [For] he does
not use the rod which is one tittle of the Iota, duplex and
varied, as a figure<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for more plagues than ten. This
Creation of the world, he says, is the ten plagues.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> For
<span class="sidenote">p. 413.</span>
everything struck produces and bears fruit as, for instance,
vine-shoots. Man, he says, has burst forth from Man, and
was severed from him by a certain blow,<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> so that he might
be born and might declare the Law which Moses laid down
after having received it from God. The Law is according
to that one tittle, the Decalogue which allegorizes the divine
mysteries of the words. For, says he, the Ten Plagues and
the Decalogue<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> are the whole knowledge of the universals
which none has known who has been misled concerning
the offspring of the woman. And if you say that the whole
Law is a Pentateuch, it is [still] from the pentad which is
comprised in the one tittle. But the whole Law is for
those who have not thoroughly crippled their understanding
[a] mystery, a new feast not yet grown old, legal
and eternal, a Passover of the Lord God kept unto our
generations by those who can see [and] beginning on the
14th [day] which is the beginning, he says, of the decad
from which they reckon.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> For the monad up to 14 is the
sum total of the one tittle of the perfect number. And
<span class="sidenote">p. 414.</span>
one + two + three + four become ten, wherefore it is the
one tittle. But from fourteen up to twenty-one, a hebdomad
subsists in the one tittle, the unleavened creature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
world in all these.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> For what, says he, should the one
tittle want of any substance like leaven for the Passover of
the Lord, the eternal feast which is given for generations.
For the whole cosmos and all the causes of creation are the
Passover Feast of the Lord. For God rejoices in the
transmutation of creation which is wrought under the
strokes of the one tittle. The which is the rod of Moses
given by God, which strikes the Egyptians and changes the
bodies, as did the hand of Moses, from water into blood.
And the other [plagues] are in nearly the same way [such
as that of the] locusts, wherefore change of the elements he
calls flesh into grass: “for all flesh is grass,”<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> he says.
<span class="sidenote">p. 415.</span>
But none the less do these men in some such way receive
the whole Law. Following, perhaps, as it seems to me, the
Greeks who say that there are Substance and Quality and
Quantity and Relation and Position and Action and Possession

<p>15. So for example Monoimus himself says distinctly in
his letter to Theophrastus:<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> “Leave aside enquiry concerning
God and Creation and the like, and enquire about
Him from thyself, and learn who it is who simply makes
His own all that is within thee, saying ‘My God, my mind,
my understanding, my soul, my body.’ Learn also what
are grief and rejoicing, and love and hate, and undesired
watching and sleep, and undesired anger and love. And
if,” says he, “thou dost carefully seek out this, thou wilt
find Him in thyself [as both] one and many things after
the likeness of that one tittle, he finding the outlet for
Himself.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This then is what these [men] say, which we
are under no necessity to compare with what has been
before excogitated by the Greeks. Since it is plain from
<span class="sidenote">p. 416.</span>
their statements that they have their origin from the
geometrical and arithmetical art, which the disciples of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Pythagoras set forth more excellently. As the reader may
learn in the passages where we have before explained all
the wisdom of the Greeks.</p>

<p>But since we have sufficiently refuted Monoimus,<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> let us
see what others have elaborated who wish thereby to raise
for themselves an idle name.</p>


<h3 id="VIII_3">3. <i>Tatian.</i></h3>

<p>16. But Tatian, although himself a disciple of Justin
Martyr, was not of like mind with his master, but attempted
something new. He says that there were certain Aeons
[about whom] he fables in the like way with the Valentinians.
But in the same way as Marcion he says that
marriage is destruction. And he asserts that Adam will
not be saved, through his becoming a leader of rebellion.
And thus Tatian.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>


<h3 id="VIII_4">4. <i>Hermogenes.</i></h3>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 417.</span>
17. A certain Hermogenes<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> thinking also to devise something
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
new, says that God created all things from co-existent
and ungenerated matter. For he held it impossible that
God should create the things that are from those that are not.
And that God is ever Lord and Maker, but Matter ever a
slave and [in process of] becoming. But yet not all
[matter], for, as it was being borne about violently and
disorderly, He set it in order in this manner. Beholding
it boiling like a pot on the fire, He divided it into parts;
and that part which he took from the All He reclaimed,
and the other He allowed to be borne about disorderly.
And the reclaimed part, he says, is the cosmos; and that the
other remains waste and is called acosmic<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> matter. He says
that this is the essence<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of all things, as if he were introducing
<span class="sidenote">p. 418.</span>
a new doctrine to his disciples; but he does not
consider that this fable happens to be Socratic, and is
better worked out by Plato than by Hermogenes. But he
confesses that Christ is the Son of the God who created all
things, and that He was begotten of the Virgin and of
Spirit according to the [common] voice of the Gospels.
Who after He had suffered rose again in a body and
appeared to His disciples, and ascending to the heavens,
left His body in the Sun, but Himself went on into the
presence of the Father. And in witness of this,<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> he thinks
he is corroborated by the word which David the Psalmist
spake: “In the Sun he set up his tent, and like a bridegroom
coming forth from his bridal chamber, he will rejoice
like a giant to run his course.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This then is what
Hermogenes attempts.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>


<h3 id="VIII_5" title="5. About the Quartodecimans.">5. <i>About the Quartodecimans.</i><a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></h3>

<p>18. But certain others, lovers of strife by nature, unskilled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 419.</span>
in knowledge, very quarrelsome by habit, maintain
that the Passover ought to be kept on the 14th day of the
First Month, according to the ordinance of the Law, on
whatever day [of the week] it may fall. They have regard
[merely] to that which has been written in the Law: [that
is] that he will be accursed who does not keep it as it is
laid down. They pay no attention to the fact that it was
enacted for the Jews, who were to kill the True Passover.
Which [Law] has spread to the Gentiles and is understood
by faith, not kept strictly in the letter. They pay attention
to this one commandment, but do not regard the saying
of the Apostle: “For I bear witness to every man who
is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole Law.”<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
In other matters they agree concerning all things handed
down to the Church by the Apostles.</p>


<h3 id="VIII_6" title="6. Phrygians.">6. <i>Phrygians.</i><a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></h3>

<p>19. But there are others also very heretical by nature,
Phrygians by race, who have fallen away after being deceived
<span class="sidenote">p. 420.</span>
by certain women, Priscilla and Maximilla by name, whom
they imagine to be prophetesses. Into these they say the
Spirit Paraclete has entered and they likewise glorify [even]
above these one Montanus as a prophet. Having endless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
books of their own, they are not judging what is said in
them according to reason, nor giving heed to those capable
of judgment; but, carried along heedlessly by the faith that
they have in them, imagine that they learn more through
them than from the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospels.
They glorify these wenches<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> above Apostles and every
grace,<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> since some of them dare to say that there are those
among them who have become greater than Christ. They
confess that God is the Father of the universals, and the
creator of all things in the same way as [does] the Church,
and also [confess] whatever the Gospel testifies concerning
Christ. But they innovate in the matter of feasts and fasts
and the eating of vegetable food and roots,<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> thinking that
they have learned this from the women. And some of
them, agreeing with the heresy of the Noetians, say that
the Father is the Son, and that He by being born, underwent
<span class="sidenote">p. 421.</span>
both suffering and death. Concerning these, I shall
later explain more minutely; for to many their heresy has
become the starting-point of evils. We judge then that
what has been said is sufficient, we having proved briefly to
all that their many absurd books and attempts are feeble
and not worth consideration, whereto those of sound mind
need pay no heed.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>


<h3 id="VIII_7">7. <i>Encratites.</i></h3>

<p>20. But others calling themselves Encratites<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> confess the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
[facts] about God and Christ in like manner with the
Church. But with regard to the way of life, they having
become puffed up,<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> have reverted [to earlier opinions].
They think themselves glorified through food by abstaining
from things which have had life, drinking water, and forbidding
marriage, and in the other things of life are austerely
careful. Such as they are judged to be rather Cynics than
Christians, seeing that they pay no heed to what was said to
them aforetime through the Apostle Paul, who prophesied
the innovations that would come by the folly of some, saying
<span class="sidenote">p. 422.</span>
thus:&mdash;“The Spirit says expressly: In the last times
some will fall away from the wholesome teaching,<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> giving
heed to deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons,
through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in
their own consciences as with a hot iron, forbidding to marry
and (commanding) to abstain from meats, which God
created to be received with thanksgiving by those who
believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is
good, and nothing is to be rejected which is received with
thanksgiving; for it is sanctified through the words of God
and prayer....”<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This saying then of the Blessed Paul
is sufficient for the refutation of those who live thus and
honour themselves as righteous men, and to show that this
also is a heresy.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>But although some other heresies are named [to wit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
those] of the Cainites, Ophites or Noachites<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and others
such as they, I do not think it necessary to set forth their
sayings and doings, lest they should thereby think themselves
somebody or worthy of argument.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But since what
<span class="sidenote">p. 423.</span>
has been said about them seems to be sufficient, we will
come to the source of all evils, the heresy of the Noetians,
and having disclosed its root and proved plainly the poison
lurking within it, we will hold back from such error those
who have been swept away by a violent spirit as by a
torrent.</p>


<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_490" href="#FNanchor_490" class="label">[1]</a> Who these Docetae are is a puzzle. Although Cruice writes the
name Δοκήται, Salmon (<i>D.C.B.</i>, s.h.n.) gives it as Δοκιταί which is,
he says, the spelling adopted by both Hippolytus and Clement of
Alexandria. Their tenets as here described have nothing to do with the
opinion that the body of Jesus existed in appearance only which we have
seen current among the Simonians, Basilidians, Marcionites, and the
followers of Saturninus and perhaps of Valentinus. Nor does it seem
connected with any proper name such as the fictitious one of Ebion
which was invented to explain to Greek ears the appellation of the
Ebionites. It may be thought, perhaps, that it was a kind of nickname
derived from this chapter’s opening metaphor of the δοκός or
“beam,” but this is too far-fetched to be insisted upon. Clement is the
only early author who mentions them, and then does so in a fashion (<i>e. g.</i>
<i>Strom.</i>, VII, 17) which makes it fairly clear that it is those who held
Docetic opinions generally so called, and not any special sect to which
he is referring. He also says that Julius Cassianus, a Valentinian, was
the founder of Docetism of the Simonian kind and St. Jerome
(<i>adv. Lucifer</i>, 23) takes this further back by the statement that the
opinion in question was current in the life-time of the Apostles. Nor
is there anything novel or peculiar in the doctrines set forth in our text
of the Docitae or Docetae. The image of the fig-tree with which this
chapter opens is but an amplification of the “Indivisible Point” put
forward earlier in our text, and there is nothing here stated which is
inconsistent with the teachings of Valentinus. This will be further
discussed when we come to consider the source of this chapter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_534" href="#FNanchor_534" class="label">[45]</a> The source of this chapter can hardly have been a written book or
MS. The style is distinctly that of Hippolytus himself; the passion
for plays on words which he has before exhibited, but has kept under
restraint while quoting from serious writers like Basilides and
Valentinus, here resumes its sway; and he adds to it a fancy for
putting several nominatives in apposition without the τουτέστι which he
has heretofore generally employed. This, and the nature of the rhetoric
all go to show that he is here quoting not from a written, but from a
spoken discourse. The author of this is of course unknown to us; and
Hippolytus, who may very likely have forgotten his name, gives us no
clue to his identity; but it is fairly clear that he must have been a
follower of Valentinus. The Three Aeons who went forth from the
first ἀρχὴ τῶν ὅλων correspond to the Nous, Logos and Anthropos
who rule over the Valentinian Ogdoad, Decad and Dodecad, and the
care taken to bring the number of Aeons up to thirty practically settles
this, while the existence of Horos is hinted at, and that of the Sophia
is barred only by the attribution of both sexes to all the Aeons.
Perhaps, however, the most striking proof of Valentinianism is the
myth of all the Aeons coalescing to produce the Jesus who brings
salvation, a myth which is not to be found in any other system. If the
theory be accepted that Hippolytus’ source for the chapter was a
Valentinian sermon, the name of Julius Cassianus as its author deserves
consideration. He is described by Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom.</i>, III,
13, sqq.) as the founder of Docetism, and as connected with the school
of Valentinus, while certain Logia quoted by him appear also in the
Valentinian <i>Excerpta Theodoti</i>. For other particulars about him see
<i>D.C.B.</i>, s.nn. “Cassianus” and “Docetism.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_535" href="#FNanchor_535" class="label">[46]</a> This “Monoimus Arabs” is known to no other heresiologist save
Theodoret who here as elsewhere probably copied from Hippolytus.
Salmon (<i>D.C.B.</i>, s.n. “Monoimus”) suggests that the name may
cover the Jewish appellation of Menahem, which is not unlikely. His
system as here disclosed has this in common with that of the Ophites
or Naassenes of Book V that both begin with a Divine Being called
“Man” for no other assigned reason than that his manifestation here
below is known as the Son of Man. He is not, however, here called
Adamas as with the Naassenes, and the remark about his being at
once father and mother is not necessarily connected with the Naassene
hymn quoted on p. 140 Cr. For the rest, there is, <i>pace</i> Salmon,
nothing distinctly Christian about Monoimus’ doctrine, and although
the passage from Colossians about the Pleroma dwelling in the Son of
Man is here again introduced, the context makes it possible that this
is the comment of Hippolytus rather than a direct quotation. On the
other hand, Monoimus several times speaks slightingly of those who
believe that the Son of Man was born of a woman, and he shows a
reverence for the Law and the Passover which a Christian of the
second century would hardly have exhibited. His opinions seem in
fact to be more pantheistic than Christian or Judaic, although
as Macmahon truly remarks, his similes about the Creation are not far
removed from those of Philo. His remarks about numbers have
possibly been corrupted in the copy, and are unintelligible as they
stand; but it is not unlikely that they cover some early Cabalistic
notions and that his “Perfect Man” may be the Adam Cadmon of the
Cabala.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_557" href="#FNanchor_557" class="label">[68]</a> This short notice of Tatian is condensed from the almost equally
short notice of Irenæus (I, xxviii.), who seems to connect Tatian with
the sect of Encratites. Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, I, xvi.), while mentioning
him as a pupil of Justin, does not speak of him as a heretic. Epiphanius
(<i>Haer.</i>, XLVI) follows Irenæus, and Theodoret (<i>Haer. Fab.</i>, I,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_558" href="#FNanchor_558" class="label">[69]</a> Of this Hermogenes we know already from Tertullian’s tract
against him to be found in the second volume of Oehler’s edition
of Tertullian’s works. The date of this tract is said on good authority
to be 206 or 207 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and as it speaks of Hermogenes as then
living, gives us his approximate date also. It is further said that
he was a painter, probably of mythological subjects, that he lived
at Carthage, and that he was several times married. Clement of
Alexandria also mentions him, and it is suggested that both Tertullian
and Clement drew from a tract against him said by Eusebius
to have been written by Theophilus of Antioch. The heretical tenets
with which he is charged are his contention that God could not have
created the world from nothing and that Matter must therefore be co-existent
with Him, that Christ on His Ascension left His body in the
Sun, and that Adam was not saved. The first of these Tertullian
would derive from Stoic teaching, while he does not touch on the
second, which is, however, recorded by Clement, nor on the third,
which Irenæus (I, xxviii) attributes to the Encratites. It is probable,
however, that all three may be derived from the Western Asian
tradition, which later gave birth to Manichæism, of which therefore
Hermogenes’ heresy may prove to have been a forecast.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_564" href="#FNanchor_564" class="label">[75]</a> This is, I think, the first mention of the Quartodecimans as
heretics. Eusebius, who thinks that the schism on the point began in
the reign of Commodus, treats them with great tenderness, and says
(<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, cc. xxiii. and xxiv.), that “the Churches of all Asia” held
their opinions, and that Irenæus himself pleaded their cause before
Pope Victor. Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>, XXX) says that they derived their
origin from a mixture of the Phrygian and Quintillian or Priscillianist
sects, probably confusing them with the Montanists.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_566" href="#FNanchor_566" class="label">[77]</a> This heresy of the “Phrygians” is, of course, that generally
called the Montanist, which seems to have broken out about the year
180. For some time it was not violently opposed by the orthodox, and
Tertullian himself became a convert to it and probably died in its confession.
Later it came to be looked upon as an enemy only one
degree less prejudicial to the Catholic Church than Gnosticism, and
therefore one to be stamped out by excommunication in pre-Constantinian
times, and by persecution afterwards. Its tenets are sufficiently
summarised in our text for a general understanding of them and their
connection with later forms of Patripassianism; but any one wishing to
go further into the subject is recommended to read Dr. Salmon’s able
article on “Montanus” in <i>D.C.B.</i>, which will give him all that is really
known as to the sect and its tendencies. Its centre seems to have been
always Asia Minor.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_570" href="#FNanchor_570" class="label">[81]</a> There is no reason to believe that in what he says here Hippolytus
is drawing from any written document. As the Montanists on being
condemned by the rest of the Church appealed first to the Gallic
Churches in which Hippolytus’ master Irenæus was a leading spirit,
and later to the Church of Rome, all that he says about them
must have been familiar to his hearers without referring to any earlier
writers.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_571" href="#FNanchor_571" class="label">[82]</a> Ἐγκρατῖται, from ἐγκρατεῖς, “the continent ones.” Many Gnostic
sects, <i>e. g.</i> those of Saturninus and Marcion seem to have been called
Encratites, the reason given by themselves for their abstinence being
the malignity of matter. But it is plain from Hippolytus’ statement as
to the orthodoxy in other matters of those he describes, that these
were not Gnostics, but Catholics who practised asceticism inordinately.
This is doubtless his reason for quoting St. Paul against them and for
ignoring Irenæus’ statement that Tatian was their founder, that they
taught a system of Aeons and denied the salvation of Adam. Bearing
in mind that he thought the Docetae to be an independent sect, it
seems probable that in this Book he intended to turn his back upon
the Gnostics and to describe only the other sects with a closer resemblance
to orthodox Judaism and Christianity. The whole work would
thus form a roughly graduated scale extending from the undisguised
heathenism of the Ophites to the purely theological errors of Callistus,
the description of which seems designed to form the climax of the book.
The fact that it was probably, as said in the Introduction, begun, laid
aside, and then taken up again and finished, is sufficient to account for
discrepancies like that involved in the concluding sentence of this
Book.</p>

Valentinus. The Noachites are mentioned by no other writer. It is
difficult to account for the remarks of Hippolytus about the Ophites in
this passage in view of the fact that the greater part of Book V has
been devoted to the doctrines of the “Naassenes”&mdash;a word which he
evidently recognized as identical with “Ophites.” Unless we are to
believe that Ὀφιτῶν is here a copyist’s error for the name of some other
sect, we are almost compelled to accept the theory given in the Introduction,
<i>i. e.</i> that the materials for Book V only came into Hippolytus’
hands after the rest of the book was written, and that their heresy was
then suddenly pitchforked into the place in which we find it without
due consideration of its accord with passages like the present. In that
case the “seven Books before this” on p. 397 Cr. must originally have
read “five,” unless we are to suppose that their place was occupied by
the description of the Jewish sects later transferred to Book IX.</p>

<p>6. A long fight has now been fought by us concerning
all [early] heresies, and we have left nothing unrefuted.
There still remains the greatest fight of all, [to wit] to
<span class="sidenote">p. 425.</span>
thoroughly describe and refute the heresies risen up in our
own day, by means whereof certain unlearned and daring
men have attempted to scatter the Church to the winds,
[thereby] casting the greatest confusion among all the
faithful throughout the world. For it seems fit that we
should attack the opinion which was the first cause of
[these] evils and expose its roots, so that its offshoots, being
thoroughly known to all, may be contemned.</p>


<div class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</div>
<h3 id="IX_1">1. <i>About Noetus.</i></h3>

<p>7. There was a certain man, Noetus<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by name, by birth
a Smyrnæan. He introduced a heresy from the opinions
of Heraclitus. Of which [Noetus], a certain man named
Epigonus becomes the minister and pupil, and on his
arrival at Rome sowed broadcast the godless doctrine.
Whose teaching Cleomenes, by life and manners alien to
the Church, confirmed, when he had become his disciple.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 426.</span>
At that time Zephyrinus, an ignorant and greedy man,
thought that he ruled the Church, and, persuaded by the
gain offered, gave leave to those coming to him to learn of
Cleomenes.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And himself also being in time beguiled,
ran into the same errors, his fellow-counsellor and comrade
in this wickedness being Callistus, whose life and the heresy
invented by him, I shall shortly set forth. The school of
these successive [teachers] continued to grow stronger and
increased through the help given to it by Zephyrinus and
Callistus. Yet we never yielded, but many times withstood
them to the face, refuted them, and compelled them perforce
to confess the truth. They being ashamed for a season,
and being brought by the truth to confession, before long
returned to wallowing in the same mire.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
8. But since we have pointed out the genealogical
succession of these [men], it appears left to us to set forth
their evil mode of teaching their doctrines. The opinions
of Heraclitus the Obscure being first explained, we shall
then make evident the parts of [their doctrines] which are
<span class="sidenote">p. 427.</span>
Heraclitan, but which, perhaps, the present chiefs of the
heresy do not know to be those of the Obscure, but think
to be those of Christ. Should they meet with these [words],
they might, thus being put to shame, cease from their
godless blasphemy.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And although the teachings of Heraclitus
have been before expounded by us in this [our]
<i>Philosophumena</i>,<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> yet it seems expedient to repeat them
now, so that by their closer refutation, those who think they
are disciples of Christ may be plainly taught that they are
not His, but are those of the Obscure.</p>

<p>9. Now Heraclitus says that the All is (one),<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> divided
[and] undivided, originated [and] unoriginated, mortal [and]
immortal, reason [and] eternity,<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Father [and] Son, a just
God. “It is wise,” says Heraclitus, “that those who
listen, not to me, but to reason,<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> should acknowledge all
things to be one.” And because all men do not know nor
acknowledge this, he reproves them somehow thus: “They
do not understand how anything that is diverse can agree
<span class="sidenote">p. 428.</span>
with itself. It is an inverse harmony, like that of a bow
and a lyre.” But that the All is ever Reason<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and exists by
it, he thus declares:&mdash;“That this Reason ever exists, men
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
do not understand either before they hear it or when they
hear it first. For while all things come to pass according
to this Reason, they seem to be ignorant of it, although
they seem to have attempted endlessly<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by words and
deeds such a description as I now give by analysis of their
nature and by saying how things are.” But that the All is
a Son and for ever an eternal being of the universals, he
says thus: “A boy playing at tables<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is Eternity; the
kingdom is a boy’s.” That he is father of all things that
have been generated, begotten and unbegotten, the creation
and [its] Demiurge, we have his saying: “War is father of
<span class="sidenote">p. 429.</span>
all, but king of all; and it displays some men as gods,
others as men; some it makes slaves, others free. Because
[this]<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is a harmony like that of bow and lyre.” But that
the unapparent, the unseen and unknown by men is [better],<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
he says in these words: “An unapparent harmony is better
than an apparent.” He thus commends and admires
that which is unknown to him before that which is known,
and the invisible before that which can be [seen]. And
that it is to be seen of men and is not undiscoverable, he
says in these words: “Whatever sight, hearing [and]
learning can receive,<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I honour before all,” he says, that is,
[I prefer]<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the things seen to those unseen. From such
phrases of his it is easy to comprehend his argument. He
says that men are deceived in regard to the knowledge of
things apparent like Homer, who was the wisest of all the
Greeks. For children when killing lice, tricked him by
<span class="sidenote">p. 430.</span>
saying: “What we see and clutch we leave behind; but
what we neither see nor clutch, we take away with us.”</p>

<p>10. Thus Heraclitus supposes the apparent to have an
equal lot and honour with the unapparent, as if the
apparent and the unapparent were admittedly one. “For,”
he says, “an unapparent harmony is better than an apparent,”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and “Whatever sight, hearing [and] learning [these are the
organs] can receive, this, he says, I honour above all,”
thus not honouring by preference the unapparent. And so
Heraclitus says that neither darkness nor light, nor good
nor evil are different,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but are one and the same. Therefore
he blames Hesiod that he did not know Day and
Night, for Day and Night, he says, are one, speaking
somehow like this: “Hesiod is the teacher of most things,
and they feel sure that he knew most things, who did not
[however] know Day and Night. For they are one.” And
[as to] good and evil:&mdash;“Now the surgeons,” says Heraclitus,
“usually cut, burn, and in every way torture the sick,
and complain that they receive from them no fitting reward
for their labours, although they do these good works on
<span class="sidenote">p. 431.</span>
the diseases.” And both straight and crooked, he says, are
the same. “The way of wool-carders, he says, is both
straight and crooked, [because] the revolution of the tool
called <i>cochleus</i><a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is both straight and crooked; for it revolves
and moves upwards at the same time. It is, he says, one
and the same.” And upward and downward are, he says,
one and the same: “The way up and down is one and
the same.” And he says that the polluted and the pure
are one and the same, and the drinkable and the undrinkable
also. “The sea,” he says, “is at once the purest and
the most polluted water, for to fish it is drinkable and
salutary, but to man undrinkable and hurtful.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And in
the same way, he says, admittedly the immortal is mortal
and the mortal immortal, in such words as these: “Deathless
are mortals, and mortals are deathless, when the living
take death from these, and the dead life from those.” But
he speaks here of the resurrection of this visible flesh
<span class="sidenote">p. 432.</span>
wherein we have been born. And he knows God to be
the cause of this resurrection, saying thus: “Those here
will rise again and will become the busy guardians of living
and dead.” And he says also that the judgment of the
ordered world and of all therein will be by fire, speaking
thus: “Thunder governs all things,” that is, it corrects
them, meaning by “thunder” the everlasting fire. But he
says also that this fire is discerning and the cause of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
government of the universals, and he calls it Need<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
Satiety. Now Need is according to him the Ordering [of
the world],<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but Satiety the Ecpyrosis. For “Fire,” he
says, “coming suddenly will judge and seize all things.”<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In this chapter [entitled] “All Things Together,” the
peculiar thought of Heraclitus is set forth.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But I have
also shown briefly that it is that of Noetus’ heresy, he being
a disciple not of Christ, but of Heraclitus. For that the
created world was its own Demiurge and creator, he declares
thus: “God is day and night, winter and summer, war and
peace, satiety and hunger.” “All things are contraries.”
This is the thought “but there is a change, as when one
<span class="sidenote">p. 433.</span>
incense is mixed with others; which [incense] is named
according to the pleasure of each.”</p>

<p>But it is plain to all that the intelligent<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> successors of
Noetus and the chiefs of the heresy, although you may
say that they were not [actual] hearers of Heraclitus, yet
by openly choosing<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the opinions of Noetus, acknowledge
the same things. For they say this: One and the same
God is the Father and Demiurge of all, having been
pleased, though invisible, to appear to the righteous men
of old. For when He is not seen He is invisible [but
when seen visible].<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And when He wishes to be uncontained,
He is uncontainable,<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and when He is contained,
He is containable. Thus by the same reasoning, He is
unconquerable<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> [and conquerable], unbegotten [and begotten],
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
immortal and mortal. How can such as they be
shown not to be disciples of Heraclitus? Did not the
Obscure long ago philosophize in these very words?</p>

<p>Now that [Noetus] says the Father and Son are the
same, no one is ignorant. These are his words. When,
then, the Father had not been born, He was rightly proclaimed
Father. And when He was pleased to undergo
<span class="sidenote">p. 434.</span>
birth, He having been begotten, became the Son of Himself
and not of another. For thus [Noetus] seems to
establish Monarchia<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> by asserting the Father and the Son
so-called are one and the same, not another from another,
but Himself from Himself. And that He is called by the
name of Father [or Son] according to the change of times.
But that One was He who appeared and underwent birth
from a Virgin and dwelt as a man among men. And
acknowledged Himself to those who saw Him to be a Son
by reason of the birth that had taken place, but did not
conceal from those who could receive it that He was also
Father. And that He also suffered, being nailed to the
Tree and gave up His Spirit to Himself, and died and
did not die. And that He raised Himself again the third
day after having been buried in a tomb and pierced with
a spear and nailed with nails. This One Cleomenes and
his band say was God and Father of the universals, thereby
drawing a Heraclitan darkness over many.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</div>
<h3 id="IX_2">2. <i>About Callistus.</i></h3>

<p>11. To this heresy Callistus<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> gave strength&mdash;a man artful
in evil and versatile in falsehood, who was seeking after the
<span class="sidenote">p. 435.</span>
bishop’s throne. And he led whither he liked Zephyrinus,<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
an ignorant man, unlearned and unskilled in the Church’s
rules, whom [Callistus] persuaded by gifts and extravagant
demands. [And as Zephyrinus] was a receiver of bribes
and a money-lover, he induced him to be ever making
faction between the brethren, while he himself by crafty
words contrived that at the last both parties should be
friendly to himself. And sometimes he deceived those who
thought truly, by saying that he thought for his own part
like things with them; and again he said likewise to those
[who held] the opinions of Sabellius, whom, when he might
have brought him into the right way, he abandoned. For
Sabellius did not harden [his heart] to our<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> admonitions,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
but when he got alone with Callistus, he was urged by him
to relapse towards the doctrine of Cleomenes, alleging that
he was of like opinions. [Sabellius] did not then understand
his trickery, but knew it afterwards, as I will shortly
explain.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Now [Callistus] bringing forward Zephyrinus himself, persuaded
him to say publicly: “I know one God, Christ Jesus,
<span class="sidenote">p. 436.</span>
and beside Him I know no other, begotten and susceptible
of suffering.” And at one time he said: “The Father did
not die but the Son,” and thus maintained without ceasing
the faction among the people.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Knowing whose designs,
we did not give way to him, but refuted and withstood him
for the Truth’s sake. He also, advancing towards madness,
through everyone concurring with him&mdash;though we did not&mdash;called
us ditheists,<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> thus violently spitting forth the concealed
poison within him. It seems good to us then to set
forth the lovable<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> life of this man since he was born at the
same time as ourselves, in order that by the mode of life of
such a one being made apparent, the heresy which he has
taken in hand may become well and quickly known to those
who have right mind. He bore witness<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> when Fuscianus
was Prefect of Rome;<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and the manner of his martyrdom
was on this wise.</p>

<p>12. [Callistus] chanced to be a house-slave of a certain
Carpophorus,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a man of the faith who was of Cæsar’s household.
To him as to one of the faith Carpophorus entrusted
no little money on his promising to bring in profit from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
business of a money-dealer. Who taking it, set up a money-changer’s
stall in the place called the <i>Piscina Publica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to
whom in course of time not a few deposits were entrusted by
<span class="sidenote">p. 437.</span>
widows and brethren on the strength of Carpophorus’ name.
But he having made everything disappear,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> was in difficulties.
When he had done this, one<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> was not lacking to tell
Carpophorus; and Carpophorus said that he required
accounts from him. Callistus being aware of this and suspecting
danger from his master,<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> took flight and made for
the sea. Who finding a ship at Portus<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> ready to sail when
she should have her cargo, went on board intending to sail.
But he could not thus escape; for one was not lacking to
tell Carpophorus what had happened. And he having
halted at the harbour according to the news given him,
tried to hurry to the ship. But she was lying in the middle
of the harbour, and the ferryman being slow, Callistus saw
his master afar off, and knew that as he was in the ship he
would be taken. So he disregarded life and thinking that
his end had come, cast himself into the sea.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But the
sailors, jumping down into the boats, dragged him out
<span class="sidenote">p. 438.</span>
against his will amid a great shouting from the shore. And
thus he was handed over to his master and taken
away to Rome, whence his master sentenced him to the
<i>Pistrinum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But time having gone on, some brethren, as generally
happens, came forward and besought Carpophorus that he
would set free the runaway from punishment, affirming that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
he had admitted having gold laid up with certain persons.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
And Carpophorus like a pious man said that he did not
care about his own [money], but that he was concerned
about the deposits. For many cried to him with tears that
they had trusted to his name when confiding money to
Callistus, and [Carpophorus] being persuaded, ordered him
to be released. But he having nothing to pay back and not
being able to run away again because he was watched,
devised a scheme for [obtaining] death. On a Sabbath day,
pretending to go forth to his debtors, he rushed into the
synagogue of the assembled Jews, and stayed there factiously
opposing them.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But when they were factiously opposed by
him, they abused and rained blows upon him and haled him
before Fuscianus, who was then Prefect of the City. And
this was their accusation:&mdash;“The Romans have conceded
to us the right to read aloud publicly the laws of our
fathers. But this man coming in forbade it, making a
<span class="sidenote">p. 439.</span>
faction against us, and affirming that he was a Christian.”
And as Fuscianus chanced to be on the judgment-seat, and
was angered by the words of the Jews against Callistus, one
was not lacking to tell Carpophorus what was being done.
And he, hastening to the judgment-seat, cried out to the
Prefect, “I beseech you, O Lord Fuscianus, do not believe
this man, for he is not a Christian, but seeks occasion of
death, having made away<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> with much money of mine, as I
will prove.”<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But the Jews thinking this to be a fetch, as
if Carpophorus were seeking by this speech to get him set
at liberty, cried out against him to the Prefect with increased
fury. And he being moved by them, had [Callistus]
scourged and sent him to a mine in Sardinia.</p>

<p>But after a time, there being other martyrs there, Marcia,
being a God-loving woman and a concubine of Commodus
<span class="sidenote">p. 440.</span>
and having wished to do some good work, summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
before her the blessed Victor, who was Bishop of the
Church at that time,<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and enquired what martyrs there were
in Sardinia. And he gave her the names of all, but did not
give her that of Callistus, knowing what he had dared to
do. Then Marcia, having succeeded in her petition to
Commodus, gave the liberating letter to an elder named
Hyacinthus, a eunuch,<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> who took it and sailed for Sardinia,
and having handed it to the Administrator<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of the place
for the time being, set free all the martyrs with the exception
of Callistus. But he, on his knees and weeping, besought
that he also might be set free. Then Hyacinthus was
moved by entreaty and required the Administrator [to do
this] affirming that he was the foster-father of Marcia and
arranging to hold the Administrator harmless. And he
being persuaded [in turn] set free Callistus also.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Upon
whose coming [to Rome], Victor was much annoyed at
what had befallen; but, as he was a compassionate man,
held his peace. But to guard against the reproach of many&mdash;for
<span class="sidenote">p. 441.</span>
the audacities of Callistus were not a long way off&mdash;and
Carpophorus was still an obstacle, he sends him to
abide in Antium, making him a certain monthly allowance
for his support.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> After [Victor’s] falling asleep, Zephyrinus
having had [Callistus] as a coadjutor in the management of
the clergy, honoured him to his own detriment, and sending
for him from Antium, set him over the cemetery.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And
Callistus being ever with [Zephyrinus], and as I have said
before, serving him with guile,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> put him in the background<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
as neither able to judge what was said to him nor to comprehend
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
all the counsels of Callistus when talking to him of
what things pleased him. Thus, after the death of Zephyrinus,
[Callistus] thinking that he had succeeded in his
pursuit,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> put away Sabellius as one who does not hold right
opinions. For [Callistus] was afraid of me and deemed
that he could thus wipe off the charge [against him] before
the Churches,<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> just as if he held no different opinions from
theirs.</p>

<p>Now Callistus was a sorcerer<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and a trickster and in time
<span class="sidenote">p. 442.</span>
snatched away many. And harbouring the poison in his
heart, and devising nothing straight, besides being ashamed
to declare the truth because he had reproached us in public,
saying: “Ye are ditheists,”<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> but especially because he had
often been accused by Sabellius of having strayed from his
first faith, he invented some such heresy as this:&mdash;He says
that the Word is the Son and that He is also the Father,
being called by that name, but being one undivided Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
And that the Father is not one thing and the Son another;
but that they subsist [as] one and the same. And that all
things above and below are filled with the Divine Spirit, and
that the Spirit which was incarnate in the Virgin was not
other than the Father, but one and the same. And that
this is the saying: “Dost thou not believe that I am in the
Father and the Father in Me?”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> For that which is seen,
which is a man, that is the Son; but the Spirit which is
contained in the Son, that is the Father. “For I do not,”
<span class="sidenote">p. 443.</span>
he says, “say that there are two Gods, Father and Son, but
One. For the Father who existed in Him, having taken on
Him the flesh, made it God by union with Himself and
made it one [Being] so that He is called Father and Son,
one God. And that this [God] being one Person cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
two.”<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> And so he said that the Father had suffered <i>with</i>
the Son; for he did not like to say that the Father suffered
and was One Person, [so as] to avoid<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> blasphemy against
the Father. [Thus this] senseless and shifty fellow, scattering
blasphemies high and low, so that he may only seem
[not] to speak against the Truth, is not ashamed to lean
now towards the doctrine of Sabellius and now towards that
of Theodotus.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The sorcerer having dared such things, set up a school
against that of the Church,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> thus to teach. And first he
contrived to make concessions to men in respect of their
pleasures, telling every one that their sins were remitted
by himself. For if any one who has been received<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> by
another and calls himself Christian should transgress, he
says, the transgression of him will not be reckoned against
him if he hastens to the school of Callistus. And many
were pleased with this proposition,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> having been stricken
with conscience as well as cast out of many heresies. And
<span class="sidenote">p. 444.</span>
some even after having been cast by us out of the Church
by a [regular] judgment, joining with these last, filled the
school of Callistus. He laid it down that if [even] a bishop
commits any sin, though it should be one unto death, he
ought not to be deposed. In his time bishops and priests
and deacons who had married twice and even thrice began
to keep their places among the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> For if any one who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
was in the clerical order<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> should marry, he [decided] that
he should remain in the order as if he had not sinned,
saying that what was spoken by the Apostle was said with
regard to this [viz.:] “Who art thou that judgest another
man’s servant?”<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> And also the Parable of the Tares, he
says spoke as to this: “Let the tares grow to the harvest,”<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
that is, let the sinners remain in the Church. But he also
said that the ark of Noah was made into an image<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of the
Church, wherein were dogs and wolves and crows and all
clean and unclean [animals]. Thus, he affirms, ought the
Church to do likewise; and as many things as he could
bring together on this point, he thus interpreted.</p>

<p>Whose hearers being attracted by these doctrines continue
[to exist], deluding themselves and many others, crowds of
<span class="sidenote">p. 445.</span>
whom flock into the school. Wherefore they are multiplied
and rejoice in the crowds, by reason of the pleasures which
Christ did not permit. Whom slightly regarding, they forbid
no one to sin, affirming that they themselves remit sins to
those with whom they are well pleased. For [Callistus] has
also permitted women, if they, being unmarried and in the
prime of life, turned towards some one unworthy of their
station, or did not wish to lessen it by [marriage], to hold
any bedfellow they might choose as lawfully married to
them, whether he was a house slave or free,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and to consider
this person although not married by law as in the
place of a husband.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> From this the so-called faithful
women began to make attempts with abortifacient drugs
and to gird themselves tightly so that they might cast out
what they had conceived, through their not wishing on
account of their family or superabundant wealth to have
a child by a slave or some mean person. See now what
impiety the lawless one has reached when he teaches
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 446.</span>
adultery and murder at the same time! And in the face of
these audacities the shameless ones attempt to call themselves
a Catholic Church, and some think that they do well
to join with them.</p>

<p>Under this [Callistus, too], a second baptism has been
ventured upon by them for the first time.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> These things
the most amazing Callistus has set on foot, whose school
still persists and preserves the customs and tradition [of the
Church], nor does it discriminate as to whom it should hold
communion with, but offers communion indiscriminately to
all. From whom also they are called by a name that they
share with him, and, by reason of the protagonist of such
works being Callistus, are called Callistians.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>


<h3 id="IX_3" title="3. Concerning Elchesaites.">3. <i>Concerning Elchesaites.</i><a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></h3>

<p>13. When the teaching of this [Callistus] had been dispersed
<span class="sidenote">p. 447.</span>
over the whole world, a certain man called Alcibiades
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
dwelling at Apamea in Syria, who was crafty and full of
impudence, and having looked into the matter, deemed
himself more forcible and expert in tricks than Callistus,
arrived in Rome bringing with him a book.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He pretended
that a righteous man (called) Elchasai, had received the
same from the Seres<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> of Parthia and gave it to one called
Sobiae,<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> as having been revealed by an angel. The height
of which angel was 24 schoeni,<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which is 96 miles; but
the girth was 4 schoeni, and from shoulder to shoulder
6 schoeni; and his footprints were 3½ schoeni in length,
which is 14 miles,<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> their width 1½ schoeni, and their depth
half a schoenus. And that there was with him also a female
whose measure, he says, accorded with those aforesaid.
And that the male is the Son of God, and that the female
is called the Holy Spirit. Describing these portents, he is
wont to distract the foolish by this address: “A new
remission of sins was brought as good news to men in the
third year of the reign of Trajan.” And he prescribes
(therefore) a baptism which I will explain (later). He affirms
that of those wrapped in all licentiousness and pollution
and breaches of the Law, if any such be a believer and turns
again and hearkens to and believes on the book, he determines
<span class="sidenote">p. 448.</span>
that he shall receive by baptism remission of sins.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
These tricks he audaciously elaborated, starting from
the doctrine before described which Callistus had brought
forward. For he, having understood that many rejoiced at
such an announcement,<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> thought that his enterprise would
be timely.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Yet we withstood him also, and did not permit
very many to go astray, refuting them<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> [with the argument]
that this was the work of a spurious<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> spirit and of a
puffed-up heart; and that the man like a wolf had risen
up among the many stray sheep which the false guide
Callistus had scattered abroad. But, since we have begun,
we shall not be silent regarding the doctrines of this man
also; and we shall bring to light the (mode of) life (he
advocates),<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and shall then prove that his supposed discipline
is a make-believe. And then again I will explain
the chief of his sayings, so that the reader who has studied
<span class="sidenote">p. 449.</span>
his writings may know thoroughly what and of what quality
is the heresy on which he has ventured.</p>

<p>14. He puts forward as a bait, conformity with the
Law,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> claiming that those who have believed ought to be
circumcised and to live according to the Law while clutching
at something from the heresies aforesaid. And he says
that Christ was a man born in the way common to all;
and that He was not now begotten for the first time from
a virgin, but that both in the first instance and then many
times since, He had been begotten and born, appeared and
grown up, alternating births and changing one body for
another, wherein He makes use of the Pythagorean teaching.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
But [the Elchesaites] are so vainglorious as to say
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
that they themselves foretell the future, starting evidently
from the measures and numbers of the Pythagorean art
before described. And they give heed to mathematics and
astrology and magic as if they were true, and they use these
things to astonish the weak-minded, so that they may think
themselves partakers in a mighty matter. They give also
incantations and spells<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to those bitten by dogs and to possessed
and other diseased persons concerning which we
<span class="sidenote">p. 450.</span>
shall not be silent. Having then sufficiently detailed the
sources and causes of their audacities, I will proceed to
repeat their writings, whereby the reader may know at once
their folly and their godless endeavours.</p>

<p>15. To his catechumens, then, [Alcibiades] administers
baptism, speaking such words as these to those whom he
deceives: “If, therefore, any one has gone in unto a child,
or to any kind of animal, or to a male or to a brother or
to a daughter, or has committed adultery or fornication, and
wishes to receive remission of sins, immediately he hears
this book, let him be baptized a second time in the name
of the Great and Highest God and in the name of His Son,
the Great King. And let him be purified and be chaste
and call to witness the seven witnesses who are written in
this book [to wit], the Heaven and the Water, and the
Holy Spirit and the Angel of Prayer and the oil and the
salt and the Earth.”<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> These are the wonderful mysteries
of Elchasai, the hidden and great things which he hands
<span class="sidenote">p. 451.</span>
down to the disciples who are worthy. And the lawless one
is not content with these, but before two or three witnesses
puts the seal on his own crimes, again speaking thus: “I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
say again, O adulterers and adulteresses and false prophets,
if you wish to turn again so that your sins may be remitted
unto you, peace shall be yours, and a portion with
the just, if immediately you hearken to this book and are
baptized a second time with your garments.”</p>

<p>But since we have said that these persons use incantations
over those bitten by dogs and over others, we shall point out
[these also]. Thus he speaks: “If a furious and mad dog
in whom is the breath of death,<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> bite or tear or touch any
man or woman or man-child or maid-child, in the same
hour let [the bitten one] run with all his clothing and go
down to a river or a pool where there is a deep place, and
let him be baptized there with all his clothing, and let him
pray<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> to the Great and Highest God in faith of heart, and
then call to witness the Seven Witnesses who are written
<span class="sidenote">p. 452.</span>
in this book, saying: ‘Lo! I call to witness the Heaven
and the Water and the Holy Spirit and the Angel of
Prayer and the oil and the salt and the Earth. I call to
witness these Seven Witnesses that I will no more sin, nor
commit adultery, nor steal, nor do injustice, nor be greedy,
nor cherish hatred, nor break faith, nor take pleasure in any
evil deeds.’ Then upon saying this, let him be baptized with
all his clothing in the name of the Great and Highest God.”</p>

<p>16. But in most other matters he talks nonsense, and
teaches [the repetition of] the same spells over the phthisical,
and the baptizing of them in cold water forty times a week.
And in the same way with those possessed of devils. O
wisdom inimitable and incantations filled full of powers!
Who will not be struck at such and so great a power of
words? But since we have said that they also make use
of the error of the astrologers, let us prove this out of their
own mouths. Thus he says: “There are evil stars of
impiety. This is now spoken unto you, O God-fearing
<span class="sidenote">p. 453.</span>
men<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and disciples. Beware of the days of their authority,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and begin no works on these days, and baptize not man nor
woman in the days of their authority when the moon goes
forth with them and journeys with them.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Be ye ware from
that day until the moon leaves them utterly and then
baptize and begin in every beginning of your works.
Honour also the Sabbath Day for it is one day out of
these.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But beware of beginning ought in the third day
from the Sabbath, because when three years of the reign
of Trajan Cæsar were fulfilled, he brought the Parthians
under his sway.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> And when three years more are completed
war will rage between the angels of the impiety of
the North,<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and thereby all the kingdoms of iniquity will
be troubled.”<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>17. Since, now, he believes it would be unreasonable
that these great and secret mysteries should be trampled
<span class="sidenote">p. 454.</span>
underfoot or delivered to many, he advises that they should
be preserved as if they were costly pearls,<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> saying thus:
“Read not these words to all men and keep their commandments
carefully, since not all men are faithful nor all
women straight.” But these things neither the sages of the
Egyptians, nor Pythagoras the sage of the Greeks withdrew
within their sanctuaries. For had Elchasai chanced
to live at the time, what need would there have been for
Pythagoras, or Thales, or Solon, or Plato the wise, or the
rest of the Greeks to learn of the priests of the Egyptians,
seeing that they would have had so much and so great
wisdom from Alcibiades, the most wonderful interpreter
of the wretched Elchasai? Now therefore it seems that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
enough has been said for persons of sound mind to have
a complete knowledge of the madness of these [heretics],
wherefore it does not seem fit to make use of any more
of their sayings, which are many and laughable.</p>

<p>But since we have not passed over the things which have
sprung up among ourselves, and have not been silent on
those which [happened] before our time, it seems proper,
so that we may go into everything and leave nothing unexpounded,
to say something of the [customs] of the Jews
<span class="sidenote">p. 455.</span>
also, and what are the differences among them; for I think
that up till now this has been passed over.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> [And] when I
shall have spoken of these,<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> I shall proceed to the exposition
of the Word of Truth.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> So that after the lengthy
struggle of the discourse against all heresies, we, firmly
pressing forward to the crown of the kingdom, and believing
on the things which are true, may not be confounded.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>


<h3 id="IX_4" title="4. Jews.">4. <i>Jews.</i><a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></h3>

<p>18. Originally there was one nation of Jews. For one
teacher had been given them by God [namely] Moses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
through him was given one Law. And there was one
desert and one mountain [namely] Sinai; for one God was
their legislator. But after they had crossed the river
Jordan and had divided by lot the land won by the spear,
they rent asunder in different ways the Law of God, each
understanding the precepts differently. And thus they set
up teachers for themselves and found out heretical opinions
and advanced in schism. Whose diversity I shall set forth;
but although for a long time they have been scattered in
many divisions, yet I will expose [only] the chief of them,
whence the lovers of learning<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> may easily know the rest.
<span class="sidenote">p. 456.</span>
For three sects<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> are distinguished among them, and the
adherents of one of these are Pharisees, of another Sadducees,
and the others<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> are Essenes. These [last] practise
the more holy life [of the three], loving one another and
observing continence. And they turn away from every
deed of concupiscence, holding it hateful even to listen to
such things. They renounce marriage, but take the
children of others and bring them up in their customs,
thus adopting<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> them and impelling them to the sciences,
[but] not forbidding them to marry, although they themselves
abstain from it. But they admit no women, even
those who are willing to devote themselves to the same
policy, nor give heed to them, for they distrust women
altogether.</p>

<p>19. And they despise wealth and do not shrink from
sharing with those who lack [it], although none of them is
richer than another. For it is a law among them that any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
one entering the heresy must sell his possessions and offer
<span class="sidenote">p. 457.</span>
the price to the common stock, which the ruler receives
and distributes to all for their needs. Thus there is no
want among them. And they use not oil, thinking anointing
their bodies pollution. But there are stewards appointed
by vote who look after all their property in common, and
all of them wear white garments always.</p>

<p>20. And there is not one city of them, but many of them
dwell in every city. And if one of the practisers of the
heresy<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> should arrive from a strange country, they hold all
things in common for him, and those whom they knew not
before they receive as guests and intimates. And they
travel about their native land, and when they go on a
journey they carry nothing with them except arms. And
they have in every city a ruler who spends what is collected
for the purpose of providing clothes and food for them.
And their dress and its fashion are modest. They do not
possess two tunics or a double set of footgear; but when
those in use become old, they take others. And they
neither buy nor sell anything at all; but if one possesses
ought, he gives it to him who lacks, and what he has not,
he receives [in its stead].<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 458.</span>
21. But they lead a well-ordered and regular life, and
always pray at dawn, not speaking before they have praised
God. And thus they all go forth and do what work
they will, and after working until the fifth hour, leave off.
Then, assembling again in one place, they gird themselves
with linen cinctures so as to conceal their privities, and
thus wash in cold water. And after having thus purified
themselves, they gather together in one dwelling&mdash;but no
one who thinks differently from them is with them in the
house&mdash;and they get to breakfast. And sitting down in
order, they are offered bread in silence, and then some one
kind of food from which each has a sufficient portion. But
none of them tastes anything till the priest has blessed and
prayed over it. And after breakfast, when he has again
prayed, they offer up praises to God. Then, laying aside
as holy the garments with which they are clothed while
indoors&mdash;and these are of linen&mdash;and receiving again the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 459.</span>
others in the vestibule, they hasten to their favourite work
until the afternoon. And they take supper in all respects as
before described. And none ever shouts, nor is any other
uproarious sound heard, but each one speaks quietly, every
one decently yielding the conversation to the other, so that
to those without the silence of those within seems somewhat
of a mystery. And they are at all times sober, eating and
drinking everything by measure.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>22. Now all give heed to the president<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and what he
commands they obey as law. For they are zealous to pity
and help the downtrodden. And before all things they
abstain from rage and anger and such-like, judging that
these betray mankind. And none takes oath to the other,
but what each one says is judged stronger than an oath.
And if any one takes an oath, he is condemned as one not
to be believed (without God).<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> And they are diligent concerning
the recital of the Law and the Prophets, and also if
<span class="sidenote">p. 460.</span>
there should be any summary<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> [of these] [made by one] of
the faithful, [they listen to it?] And they are very curious
concerning plants and stones, being very inquisitive as to
their operation, as they think that these did not come into
being in vain.</p>

<p>23. But to those who wish to become disciples of the
heresy, they do not straightway impart the traditions, until
they have first made trial of them. For a year they set
before them the same sort of food as [is served] to themselves,
but outside their assembly and in another house.
And they give them a hatchet and the linen cincture
and white garments. When they have during this period
given proof of continence, they draw nearer to the way of
living [of the others] and are purified more thoroughly than
at first, but they do not take their food with them. For
after they have shown that they can practise continence, for
another two years’ trial is made of such a one’s character,
and on his appearing worthy, he is adjudged so [to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
received] by them. Before, however, he can eat with them,
he is sworn with fearful oaths; first, that he will show piety
towards the Divine, then that he will observe justice towards
men, and will in no way wrong any, nor hate anyone who
<span class="sidenote">p. 461.</span>
wrongs him or who is an enemy to him, but will pray for him.
And that he will fight on the side of the just and will keep
faith with all, especially with those who bear sway, nor be
disobedient to them. For it happens to none to rule save
by God. And if [the aspirant] should bear rule, that he
will never be arrogant in authority, nor make more use
than is customary of any ornament; but is to love the truth,
<span class="sidenote">p. 462.</span>
to refute the liar, and not to steal, nor soil his conscience
with unlawful gain, nor hide ought from his fellow-heretics.
And will tell nothing [of their secrets] to others even if he
shall suffer violence unto death. Besides this, he swears to
them to impart none of the doctrines [of the sect] otherwise
than as he himself received them. By such oaths,
therefore, do they bind those who come unto them.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>24. But if any should be convicted in any transgression,
he is cast out of the order, and he that is cast out sometimes
perishes by a fearful fate. For, being bound by the oaths
and customs, he cannot take food with other people.
Therefore sometimes they utterly destroy the body by
famine. Wherefore in the last extremity they sometimes
take pity on many already dying, thinking the penalty unto
death sufficient for them.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>25. Concerning their judgments, they are most careful
and just. They deliver judgment after assembling not less
<span class="sidenote">p. 463.</span>
than a hundred and what they determine is irrevocable.
And they honour the Lawgiver [next] after God, and if anyone
blasphemes him, he is punished. And they are taught
to give ear to the rulers and elders; and if ten are sitting in
the same place, one will not speak unless the others wish.
And they are careful of spitting in front of them or on the
right side; and more than all the Jews, they arrange to
abstain from work on the Sabbath. For not only do they
prepare their food one day before, so as not to light a fire,
but they neither move an implement nor relieve nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
And some of them will not even get out of bed. But on
other days, when they wish to evacuate, they dig a pit a
foot long&mdash;with the hoe&mdash;for such is the hatchet which
they give their adherents when first becoming disciples<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>&mdash;and
covering it on all sides with their cloak, sit down,
affirming that they must not insult the rays [of the Sun].
Then they throw back the excavated earth into the pit.
And this they do choosing the most deserted places, [and]
when they have done this they straightway wash, as if the
<span class="sidenote">p. 464.</span>
secretion were polluting.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>26. But in course of time they have drawn apart and do
not [all] observe the discipline in the same way,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> being
divided into four parts. For some of them are more austere
than they need be, so that they will carry no coin, saying
that they must not bear any image, nor look upon it, nor
make it. Wherefore none of them goes into a city, lest he
shall enter in through a gate whereon are statues, as they
think it unlawful to pass under an image. And others, if
they hear anyone holding forth about God and His Law,
will watch such an one until he is alone in some place, and
threaten to kill him if he be not circumcised. Whom, if
he does not consent, he does not spare, but slays him.
Whence from this occurrence they take their name, being
called Zealots, but by some Sicarii. And yet others of
them name none Lord but God, even if any should torture
or slay them. And those who succeeded them became so
much worse than their discipline that they would not touch
<span class="sidenote">p. 465.</span>
those who remained in the ancient customs: [or] if they
did so [by accident] they straightway washed themselves as
if they had touched one of another sect. And the majority
are long-lived, so that they live more than a hundred years.
Now they say that the cause of this is their consummate
piety towards God, and their condemning the serving [of
food] without measure and to their being continent and
slow to anger. And they despise death rejoicing that they
can make an end with a good conscience. But if any one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
should torture such [men] to make them speak ill of the
Law or to eat food offered to idols, they would not do so,
suffering death and supporting tortures so that they may
not go beyond their conscience.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>27. But the doctrine of the Resurrection is also strong
among them. For they confess that the flesh rises again
and will be immortal in the same way that the soul is
already immortal. Which soul when it departs from the
body, abides in an airy and well-lighted place until judgment,
which place the Greeks hearing of it called [the] Islands of
the Blessed. But there are other opinions of them which
<span class="sidenote">p. 466.</span>
many of the Greeks appropriated and maintained as their
own teaching. For the discipline among them concerning
the Divine is earlier than all nations, as is proved by all
that the Greeks have ventured to say about God or the
fashioning of the things that are starting from no other
source than the Jewish Law. Wherefrom especially Pythagoras
and those of the Porch took much, having been
instructed in it by the Egyptians. And [the Essenes] say
also that there will be a judgment and a conflagration of
the All, and that the unjust will be punished everlastingly.
And prophecy and the foretelling of things to come are
practised among them.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>28. Now there is another order of Essenes making use
of their customs and way of life, but they differ from these
[just described] in the one [point of] marriage; saying that
those who reject marriage do a fearful thing. And they
declare that this comes to the taking-away of life, and that
one must not cut off the succession of children, and that
if everyone thought like this, the whole race of men might
easily be cut off. They certainly try their wives for a period
of three years; but when they have had three purifications,
so as to prove that they can bear children, they wed them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 467.</span>
But they do not company with them when pregnant, proving
[thereby] that they do not marry for pleasure but from need
of children. And the women wash themselves in the
same way and don linen garments in the same way as
the men with their cinctures. This, then, concerning the
Essenes.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>But there are others also disciplined in the customs of
the Jews, and called both legally and generically Pharisees.
The majority of whom are [to be found] in every place,
and all call themselves Jews, but on account of the special
opinions held by them are called besides by specific names.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Now they, while holding fast the ancient tradition, continue
to enquire methodically into what things are clean and what
unclean according to the Law. And they interpret the
things of the Law, putting forward teachers for that purpose.
And they say that Fate is, and that some things are due to
free-will and some to Fate, so that some [come] by ourselves
and some by Fate. But that God is the cause of all, and
that nothing is arranged or happens without His will. And
they confess the Resurrection of the Flesh and that the
<span class="sidenote">p. 468.</span>
soul is immortal, and [admit] a judgment to come and a
future conflagration, and that the wicked will be punished
in unquenchable fire.</p>

<p>29. But the Sadducees eliminate Fate, and confess that
God neither does nor contemplates anything evil; but that
man has the power to choose the good or evil. But they
deny not only the Resurrection of the Flesh, but also consider
that the soul does not survive. But that its [function]
is to live and that that is why man is born. And that the
doctrine of the Resurrection is fulfilled by leaving children
on earth when we die. But that after death there will be
no hope of suffering either evil or good. For [they say that]
there will be a dissolution of soul and body and that man
will go to that which is not in the same way as the other
animals. And that if a man has great possessions, and
having become rich is [thereby] glorified, he is so far the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
gainer; but that God does not take care of the affairs of
<span class="sidenote">p. 469.</span>
any one individual. And while the Pharisees love one
another, the Sadducees love [only] themselves. The same
heresy was especially strong round about Samaria. And
they give heed to the customs of the Law, saying that one
ought to do so that one may live well and leave children
behind on earth. But they pay no attention to the Prophets,
nor to any other wise men, but only to the Law [given]
through Moses. Nor do they interpret anything. This
then is the heresy of the Sadducees.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>30. Since now we have set forth the differences among
the Jews, it seems proper not to pass over in silence the
discipline of their service of God. Now there is a fourfold
system with regard to the service of God among all Jews
[to wit] Theological, Physical, Moral and Ceremonial.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
And they say that there is one God, the Demiurge of the
All and the Maker of all things that before were not,<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> nor
did He make them from any subordinate essence, but He
willed and created. And that there are angels and that
they have come into being for the service of creation; but
that there is also a Spirit having authority ever standing
beside Him for the glory and praise of God. And that all
things in the creation have sensation and that nothing is
without soul.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> And they pursue customs tending to a holy
<span class="sidenote">p. 470.</span>
and temperate life as is to be recognized in their Law. But
these things were of old carefully laid down by those who
originally received a God-made Law, so that the reader will
be astonished at so much moderation and care in the
customs prescribed for man. But the ceremonial service
offered in becoming fashion was excellently performed by
them as it is easy for those who wish to learn by reading
the Book discoursing on these matters.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> [There they will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
see] how reverently and devoutly they offered to God the
things given by Him for the use and enjoyment of man,
obeying Him orderly and constantly. Some of these
[doctrines] the Sadducees reject; for they hold that neither
angels nor spirit exist.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">p. 471.</span>
But all alike wait for Christ, the Coming One foretold by
the Law and the Prophets. But the time of the Coming
was not known of the Jews, [so that] the supposition endured
that the sayings which appeared to concern the Coming
were unfulfilled. But they expect that Christ will presently
come, since they did not recognize His presence. And
seeing the signs of the times of His having come already,
this troubles them, and they are ashamed to confess that He
has come, since with their own hands they became His
murderers, through anger at being convicted by Him of
not having hearkened to their Laws. And they say that
He who was thus sent by God is not Christ. But they
confess that another will come who as yet is not, and will
bear some of the signs which the Law and the Prophets
foreshowed; but some things they imagine wrongly. For
they say that his birth will be from the race of David, but
not from a Virgin and [the] Holy Spirit, but from a woman
and a man, as it is a rule for all to be begotten from seed.
And they declare that he will be a king over them, a man
of war and a mighty one, who, having gathered together the
whole nation of Jews, will make war on all the nations and
<span class="sidenote">p. 472.</span>
re-establish for them Jerusalem as the royal city. Whereunto
he will gather in the whole nation, and again will
restore the ancient customs, while [the nation] is king and
priest<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and dwells in security for a sufficient time. Then
shall again spring up against them a war of [the nations]
gathered together. In this war the Christ shall fall by the
sword and not long afterwards the end and conflagration
of the All shall draw near, and thus their conjectures about
the Resurrection shall be fulfilled, and everyone shall be
recompensed according to his works.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
31. It seems to us that the opinions of all Greeks and
Barbarians have been sufficiently set forth, and that nothing
has been left undemonstrated either of the philosophizings<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
or of the things imagined by the heretics. To those among
them [who read this], the refutation from what has been set
forth is clear [viz.] that either plagiarizing from or laying
under contribution what the Greeks have elaborated, they
have put them forward as divine. Now, having run through
all [these systems] and having declared with much labour
in the nine books [above] all these opinions, thereby leaving
to all men a little guide through life, and furnishing to the
<span class="sidenote">p. 473.</span>
readers a study of no little joy and gladness, we think it
reasonable to present as the conclusion of the whole [work]
a discourse on the Truth.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> And we shall write this in one
book, [viz.] the Tenth. So that the reader, having recognized
the overthrow which the heresies of these audacious
men have sustained, may not only despise their follies, but
by also recognizing the power of the Truth, [and] by
worthily believing in God, can be saved.</p>


<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_578" href="#FNanchor_578" class="label">[1]</a> ἡ καινὴ ἐπιδημία. The book Elchesai, as will presently be seen,
is said to have been revealed “in the third year of Trajan” and therefore
long anterior to our text. Hippolytus, therefore, probably refers
here to a recrudescence of the superstition connected therewith.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_579" href="#FNanchor_579" class="label">[2]</a> This Noetus, whom Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>, LVII) would make a native
of Ephesus, possibly by confusion with the Praxeas against whom
Tertullian wrote, was one of the first to teach the heresy called Patripassian,
which made the Father as well as the Son to suffer on the
Cross. His date is uncertain, but he was “not very long” dead when
Hippolytus wrote (see Hippolytus’ Tractate against Noetus in Gallandi,
<i>Bibl. Vet. Patr.</i> II, p. 454), and the seeds of the heresy seem to have
been sown in the time of Justin Martyr. It was undoubtedly Eastern
in origin and passed in Rome chiefly under the name of Sabellius.
Hippolytus was evidently its greatest opponent there, Zephyrinus and
Callistus maintaining a more tolerant attitude towards it, until the last-named
Pope was compelled to excommunicate Sabellius. See Salmon’s
articles in <i>D.C.B.</i>, s.n.n. “Noetus,” “Praxeas,” “Epigonus” and
“Cleomenes,” and Mr. Hugh Pope’s article on “Monarchian” in
Hastings’ <i>Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_580" href="#FNanchor_580" class="label">[3]</a> Theodoret (<i>Haer. Fab.</i>, III, 3) would reverse this position and
make Cleomenes Epigonus’ teacher and not his pupil. He has
probably misread Hippolytus on this point, the later heresiologists
frequently failing to distinguish the founders of any heresy from their
successors.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_581" href="#FNanchor_581" class="label">[4]</a> This is evidently the beginning of Hippolytus’ quarrel with the

words in the gnomic sayings of Heraclitus. The only other previous
reference to them seems to be in Book V (Vol. I, p. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_154">154</a> <i>supra</i>) where
he calls Heraclitus one of the wisest of the Greeks and in Book VI
(p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a> <i>supra</i>) where he attributes Simon’s image of “a fiery God” not to
Moses but to Heraclitus. If Cruice’s emendation holds good this shows
that Book I was originally published separately and called “Philosophizings,”
the rest of the work being known as the <i>Elenchus</i> or
“Refutation.” Cf. Introduction <i>supra</i>. Bishop Wordsworth (St.
<i>Hippolytus and the Church of Rome</i>, London, 1880), gets over the
difficulty by reading the passage ἐν τοὺς Φιλοσοφουμένους ἡμῖν, “in this
our Philosophumena,” and this reading has been adopted in this

did not profess to understand. So far as can be seen the only likeness
between his sayings and the teaching of Noetus and his successors was
due to the love of paradox shown by both. The parallel between
them that Hippolytus tries to draw is mainly forced upon him by his
own theory that all heresy is derived from Greek philosophy.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_608" href="#FNanchor_608" class="label">[31]</a> There can be little doubt as to the source of this chapter. The
quotations from Heraclitus are taken from some book of extracts, like
the work of Diogenes Laertius, and much corrupted in the taking:
the words put into the mouth of Noetus on the other hand are doubtless
taken from some written note of the arraignment of Noetus before
“the blessed presbyters” who expelled him from the Church as
described in Hippolytus’ own tract against Noetus, mentioned in n. on p.
<a href="#Page_118">118</a> <i>supra</i>. In c. 3 of this, Hippolytus declares that Noetus made use of
the same passages of Scripture as “Theodotus,” which explains the
allusion in the Table of Contents, and he uses other phrases to be
found in our text. As the whole controversy between himself and
Callistus was doubtless familiar to his readers, there was therefore no
reason for him to refer to any written document containing the opinion
of Noetus or his successors.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_609" href="#FNanchor_609" class="label">[32]</a> In this chapter, as has been said, Hippolytus discloses his chief
reason for the publication or republication of the whole work. The
controversy which raged round the evidence of schism in the Primitive
Church which it affords has now died down, and we are therefore able
to examine such evidence dispassionately. The suggestion that the
Callistus here mentioned had been confused with another person has
now been given up, and there is little doubt that Hippolytus’ adversary
was the Pope of that name who presided over the Church of Rome
between the primacies of Zephyrinus and Urbanus, this last being
quickly succeeded by Pontianus. In estimating the worth of the story
which Hippolytus here tells against him, the way has been cleared by the
frank acceptance by contemporary Catholic writers such as Monsignor
Duchesne (<i>Hist. ancienne de l’Église</i>, Paris, t. I,) and Dom.
Chapman (<i>The Catholic Encyclopædia</i>, New York, 1908, s.v. “Callistus”),
of the view that the calumnies against Callistus here put
forward, although much exaggerated and coloured, have a basis of fact.
In this, they follow the line taken by the celebrated Dr. Döllinger at
the first appearance of our text, and no modern scholar has yet been
found to seriously controvert it. It therefore only remains to draw
attention to the points in which Hippolytus has, in Dr. Döllinger’s
opinion, garbled or added colour to the facts, and on the whole, it has
seemed more satisfactory to do this in the footnotes than here. The
references, except when otherwise stated, are to the English edition
of Döllinger’s <i>Hippolytus and Callistus</i>, Edinburgh, 1876. Callistus’
primacy appears from several testimonies to have lasted from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 218
to 223, when he was killed apparently in a riot.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_658" href="#FNanchor_658" class="label">[81]</a> No other author seems to have taken up this name, and the rest of
the paragraph shows that it was Callistus’ party which was regarded as
Catholic and Hippolytus’ as schismatic. As Hippolytus was writing of
matters within his own knowledge and in some measure that of his
readers, there is no reason to suppose that he drew his material from
any written source; but it has been suggested that the facts in Callistus’
life that he here narrates may have been obtained <i>vivâ voce</i> from
Carpophorus.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_659" href="#FNanchor_659" class="label">[82]</a> This heresy of the Elchesaites was a very old one, and probably
had its roots in the Babylonian religion some millennia before Christian
times, ablution and exorcism being then considered one of the
most effectual modes of removing the consequences of transgression.
Prof. Brandt, of Amsterdam, who has paid much attention to the
Mandæan religion which has affinities with it, in his monograph on
the subject (<i>Elchasai, Ein Religionstifter und sein Werk</i>, Leipzig,
1912), thinks that Elchasai, a name which may mean something like
“Power of the Sun,” was a real man who flourished in the reign of
Trajan (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 98-117), and founded in Syria an eclectic religion
made up of the doctrines of Judaism and Christianity, mingled with
the belief in the sovereign efficacy of baptism found among the
Hemerobaptists, Mughtasila or “Washers,” who still exist. Thus,
according to En-Nadîm (Flügel’s <i>Mani</i>, p. 340), these Mughtasila in
the tenth century still reverenced as a prophet a certain Al-[H.]asih who
seems to be our Elchasai, along with Moses, Christ, and Mohammed.
It also appears that his successors sent out missionaries to the West,
including doubtless the Alcibiades of our text. Origen, in his Homily
on the 82nd Psalm, mentions having met with one of these who may
have been Alcibiades himself. They seem to have obtained some
success among the Ebionite and Essene communities on the shores of
the Dead Sea, but the effort soon died out, and Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>,
VI, 38) says that it was stifled almost at its birth. Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>,
XIX, 5; XXX, 17; and LIII, 1) mentions them in connection with the
“heresies” of the Nazaræans, Ebionites and Sampsæans respectively,
but like Theodoret does little but repeat Hippolytus’ statements.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_660" href="#FNanchor_660" class="label">[83]</a> This book which is mentioned by all the writers who refer to
Elchasai, doubtless began with the vision of the angel from whom he
professed to receive his revelations.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_666" href="#FNanchor_666" class="label">[89]</a> Hippolytus’ motive in thus connecting Alcibiades’ visit with

in the re-baptizing of reconverted heretics of which he (probably
erroneously) accuses his adversary, and the magical efficacy of the
ablution prescribed by Alcibiades.</p>

Yet they must be singular, or the seven witnesses would be more than

He also thinks that the mention of salt implies a sacrament celebrated
with bread and salt, and that earth, as one of the five elements of
Aristotle, should be substituted for the Earth as a pendant to which
Heaven is thrown in. It is simpler to derive the spell from the
ancient Babylonian religion in which Heaven and Earth are coupled

in the Cyrenaica, Egypt and Cyprus broke out within the three years

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_688" href="#FNanchor_688" class="label">[111]</a> The reasons that probably influenced Hippolytus in writing this
description of Jewish religion as a sequel to his Ninth Book are stated
in the Introduction. It is for the most part extracted from Josephus,
the order of the paragraphs following that adopted by him, and the
words being in many cases the same. This has led Cruice to suggest
that both are taken from a common source, which he takes to be a
Christian writer of the first century. This is extremely unlikely, since
Epiphanius, Porphyry and Pliny all quote Josephus directly; but it
is probable that when he leaves Josephus, as he does after the account
of the Sadducees, Hippolytus draws from the statements of some
Jewish convert to Christianity of whom we know nothing. In this,
the Messianic ideas of the Jews which brought about the great revolt
under Bar Cochba are clearly set out, but it is curious that writing as
he must have done long after the practical extermination of the Jewish
nation by Hadrian, he should have made no allusion to it; and it may
therefore well be that he preferred to condense here the statements
which Justin Martyr puts into the mouth of Trypho, with which his
own agree in almost every particular. This Ninth Book bears throughout
the marks of haste or weariness, many of the sentences, except
where he is manifestly using the work of another as model, being
slurred over and difficult to construe grammatically. In one or two
cases, he contradicts his own statements, as in the case of the Sadducees,
making a subsequent correction by himself or the scribe necessary.

SUMMARIES, AND THE WORD OF TRUTH</h2>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">These</span> are the contents of the 10th [Book] of the
Refutation of all Heresies.</p>

<p>2. An epitome of all the philosophers.</p>

<p>3. An epitome of all [the] heresies.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>4. And what is in all things the Word of Truth.</p>

<p>5. Having broken through the labyrinth<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the heresies
without violence but rather having dissolved them by our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
single refutation in the power of Truth, we now draw near
to the demonstration of the Truth itself. For then the
manufactured sophistries of the error will appear inconsistent,
when the definition of the Truth has shown that it has not
taken its beginnings from the philosophy of the Greeks.
Nor [has it taken] from [the] Egyptians [the] doctrines (and)
the follies which are adored among them as worthy of
faith&mdash;as [the] mysteries have taught&mdash;nor has it been
devised out of the inconsistent jugglery of [the] Chaldæans,
nor been forged by the unreasoning madness of [the]
Babylonians through the activity of demons.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In whatever
shape, however, the definition subsists, it is true, unguarded,
and unadorned,<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and by its appearance alone will refute the
<span class="sidenote">p. 475.</span>
error. Concerning which, although we have many times
made demonstrations, and have pointed out the Rule of
Truth sufficiently and abundantly for those who are willing
to learn, yet once again we judge it reasonable on the top of
all the doctrines of the Greeks and heretics, to place as if it
were [the] crown of the books [preceding], this demonstration
by means of the tenth book.</p>

<p>6. Now having brought together the teachings of all the
sages among [the] Greeks in four books,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and those of the
heresiarchs in five, we shall point out the Doctrine concerning
the Truth in one, after having first made a summary
of what has been the opinions of all. For the teachers of
the Greeks, dividing philosophy into three parts, so philosophize,
some preaching Physics, some Ethics and some
Dialectic.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And those who preached Physics thus declared,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
some that all things were born from one, others from many.
And of those who said [they came] from one, some [said
they came] from what had no Quality, and others from that
which had Quality. And of those who [said they came]
from that which had Quality, some [said that they came]
<span class="sidenote">p. 476.</span>
from fire, others from air, others from water and yet others
from earth. And of those who [said they came forth] from
many things, some [said that they came] from numerable
things [others from boundless ones. And of those who said
they came from numerable things], some [say that they came]
from two, others from four, others from five, and others
from six. And of those [who say] that they came from the
boundless things, some [say that they came] from things
like generated things, others from those unlike. And some of
them say that they came from things impassible, others from
things passible. The Stoics indeed would establish the
birth of the universals from that which has no Quality and
one body. For according to them, matter unqualified and
capable of change by means of the universals is their source.
And when it is transformed, fire, air, water and earth come
into being. And those who will have all things to come
into being from that which has Quality are the followers
of Hippasus and Anaximander and Thales the Milesian.
Hippasus the Metapontian<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Heraclitus the Ephesian
declared the genesis of things to be from fire, but Anaximander
from air, Thales from water, and Xenophanes from
earth.</p>

7. Of those who would derive the universals from [the]
many and [the] numerable, the poet Homer declares that
the universals have been composed of earth and water when
he says:&mdash;</p>

And Xenophanes the Colophonian seems to agree with him,
for he says:&mdash;

six, the followers of Empedocles derived the birth of all
things. For in the verses where he says:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Hear first the four roots of all things”</div>

<p class="noin">he is handing down six things as sources of the universals
[<i>i. e.</i>] four material: earth, water, fire, [and] air and two,
<span class="sidenote">p. 479.</span>
the agents Love and Strife. But the followers of Anaxagoras
the Clazomenian and Democritus and Epicurus and
very many others whose [opinions] we have before recorded
in part, taught that the genesis of all things was from the
boundless. But Anaxagoras says they came from things
like those produced; but the followers of Democritus and
Epicurus, from those unlike and impassible, that is from
the atoms; and those of Heraclides the Pontian<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
Asclepiades<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> from those which are unlike, but passible, such
as disconnected corpuscles. But the followers of Plato say
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
that they came from three, and that these are God, Matter
and Exemplar; but he divides matter into four principles:
fire, water, earth, air; and says that God is the Demiurge
of Matter, but Exemplar the Mind.</p>

<p>8. Now, having been persuaded that the system of
Natural Science<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is confessedly found unworkable by all
these [philosophers], we ourselves shall unhesitatingly say
concerning the examples of the Truth what they are and
how we believe in them. But in addition we will first set
forth in epitome the [opinions] of the heresiarchs, so that
<span class="sidenote">p. 480.</span>
the opinions of all being thereby easy to discern, we may
display the Truth as clear and easy to discern also.</p>


<h3 id="X_1">1. <i>Naassenes.</i></h3>

<p>9. But since this seems fitting, we will begin first with
the ministers of the serpent. The Naassenes call the first
principle of the universals a man and also Son of Man,<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and him they divide into three. For part of him, they say,
is intellectual, part psychic, and part earthly. And they
call him Adamas and think the knowledge of him is the
beginning of the power to know God. And they say that
all these intellectual and psychic and earthly [parts] came
into Jesus, and that the three substances spoke together
through Him to the three races of the All. Thus they
declare that there are three races, [the] angelic, psychic
[and] earthly, and that there are three Churches, angelic,
psychic and earthly; but that their names are [the] Called,
Chosen, [and] Captive. These are the heads of their
doctrine in so far as it can be briefly comprehended. They
<span class="sidenote">p. 481.</span>
say that they were handed down by James the Brother of
the Lord to Mariamne, thereby belying both.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<div class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</div>
<h3 id="X_2">2. <i>Peratæ.</i></h3>

<p>10. But the Peratæ, Ademes the Carystian and Euphrates
the Peratic<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> say that a certain cosmos&mdash;this is what they
call it&mdash;is one divided into three. But of this threefold
division of theirs, there is a single source, as it were a great
fountain, capable of being cut by the reason into boundless
sections. And the first and most excellent section is
according to them the triad and the one part of it is called
Perfect Good [and] Fatherly Greatness. But the second
part of the Triad is, as it were a certain boundless multitude
of powers, and the third is that of form. And the first [of
the Triad] is unbegotten (since it is good: but the second
good and self-begotten and the third, begotten).<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Whence
they say explicitly that there are three gods, three words,
<span class="sidenote">p. 482.</span>
three minds [and] three men. For to each part of the
cosmos when the division was made, they assign Gods and
Words and Men and the rest. But from on high, from the
unbegotten state and from the first section of the cosmos,
when the cosmos had already been brought to completion,
there came down in the time of Herod a certain triple-natured
and triple-bodied and triple-powered man called
Christ, having within Him all the compounds and powers
from the three parts of the cosmos. And this they will
have to be the saying: “In Him dwells all the Fulness of
the Godhead bodily.” For [they say that] there came down
from the two overlying worlds, namely from the unbegotten
and the self-begotten, to this world in which we are, all sorts
of seeds of powers. And that Christ came down from the
Unbegottenness in order that through His descent all the
things triply divided may be saved. For the things, he
says, brought down from on high shall ascend through
Him; but those who take counsel together against those
brought down shall be ruthlessly rejected and having been
punished shall be sent away. And he says that those
[worlds] which will be saved are two, the overlying ones
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 483.</span>
released from corruption. But the third will be destroyed,
which is the world of form.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And thus the Peratæ.</p>


<h3 id="X_3">3. <i>The Sethiani.</i></h3>

<p>11. But to the Sethians it appears that there are three
definite principles of the universals. And that each of
these principles (has boundless powers&nbsp;... everything
which you perceive by your mind or which you pass over
for lack of thought)<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is formed by nature to become [each of
the principles] as in the human soul every art is to be learned.
As if [they say] there should come to a boy spending some
time with a pipe-player, the power of pipe-playing, or with a
geometrician the power of measurement, or in like manner
with any other art. But the substances of the principles,
they say, are light and darkness. And between them is
pure spirit. But the spirit which is set between the darkness
which is below and the light which is above is, they say, not
spirit like a gust of wind or any small breeze which may be
perceived, but resembles some faint fragrance of balsam or
<span class="sidenote">p. 484.</span>
of incense artificially compounded as a power penetrating
by force of fragrance and better than words can say. But
because the light is above and the darkness below and the
spirit between them, the light, like a ray of the sun on high,
shines on the underlying darkness, and the fragrance of the
spirit holding the middle place is borne and spread abroad
as the odour of incense on the fire is borne. And as the
power of the triply divided is such, the power of the spirit
and the light together are below in the darkness beneath.
But, they say, the darkness is a fearful water into which the
light is drawn down with the spirit and changed into a
similar nature. Now the darkness is sensible, and knows
that if the light is taken away from it, the darkness will
remain desolate, viewless, without light, powerless, idle and
weak. In this way by all its wit and foresight it is forced
to retain within itself the brilliance and scintillation of the
light along with the fragrance of the spirit.</p>

<p>And with regard to this, they bring in this image, saying
that as the pupil of the eye appears dark because of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 485.</span>
waters underneath it, but it is made light by the spirit, thus
the light seeks after the spirit and retains for itself all the
powers which wish to withdraw and to depart. But these
are ever boundless, wherefrom all things are modelled and
become like mingled seals. For, as the seal coming into
conjunction with the wax, makes the impress, while itself
remains by itself whatever it was, so the powers coming
into conjunction with each other elaborate all the boundless
races of living things. Therefore [they say] came into
being from the first conjunction of the three principles, the
form of a great seal [<i>i. e.</i>] of heaven and earth, which had
a shape like a womb with the navel in the midst. Thus
also the rest of the models of all things were modelled
resembling a womb like heaven and earth. But they say
that from the water came into being the first born principle,
a violent and rushing wind the cause of all generation,
which sets in action a certain heat and movement in the
cosmos from the movement of the waters. And [they say]
<span class="sidenote">p. 486.</span>
that this was changed into a complete form like the hissing
of a serpent, beholding which the cosmos is driven to
generation, being excited like a womb, and therefrom they
will have it the generation of the universals is established.
And they say that this wind is a spirit and that a perfect
god came into being from the waters and from the fragrance
of the spirit and from the brilliance of the light.
And that there is also the begetting of a female, Mind, the
spark from on high which is mingled with the accretions
of the body and hastens to flee away so that it may escape
and not find dissolution through being enchained in the
waters. Whence it cries aloud from the mingling of the
waters according to the Psalmist, as they say. “Thus
the whole care of the light on high is how it shall draw
the spark beneath from the Father who is below,” [that is],
from the wind which puts in action heat and disturbance
and creates for himself Mind (a perfect son) who is not
(peculiar) to himself, [whom] they declare, beholding the
<span class="sidenote">p. 487.</span>
perfect Word of the light from on high, changed Himself
into the form of a serpent and entered into a womb, so
that He might take again that mind which is a spark of
the light. And this, [they say] is the saying: “Who, being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
And this the unhappy and wicked Sethians will have to be
the [servile] form.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This then is what they say.</p>


<h3 id="X_4">4. <i>Simon.</i></h3>

<p>12. And the all-wise Simon says thus. There is a
boundless power and this is the root of the universals.
The boundless power is, he says, fire. According to him,
it is not simple, as the many say the four elements are
simple and therefore think fire is simple; but [he says] that
the nature of the fire is double, and of this double [nature]
he calls one part hidden and the other manifest. And
<span class="sidenote">p. 488.</span>
that the hidden parts are concealed within the manifest
parts of the fire, and the manifest parts of the fire are produced
by the hidden. But, he says, that all the seen and
unseen parts of the fire are to be considered as having
sense.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Therefore, he says, the begotten world came into
being from the unbegotten fire. But it began to come
into being, he says, thus. The begotten [cosmos] took
from the principle of that fire the first six roots of the
principle of generation. For these six roots were born
from the fire by pairs, which he calls Nous and Epinoia,
Phonê and Onoma, Logismos and Enthymesis. And [he
says] that in these six roots [taken] together, the Boundless
Power exists (potentially but not actively, which Boundless
Power) he says is the “He who Stands, Stood, and
will Stand,” which if it be exactly reflected will be within
the six powers in substance, powers, greatness and influence,
being one and the same as the Unbegotten and Boundless
Power, and in no way inferior to that Unbegotten and
Unchangeable and Boundless Power. But if it remains
only potentially in the Six Powers and is not exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 489.</span>
reflected, it, he says, vanishes and will die away like the
grammatical or geometrical power in the mind of a man,
when he does not receive technical teaching in addition.
And Simon says that himself is the He Who Stands, Stood,
and will Stand, being the Power which is above all.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Thus,
then, Simon.</p>


<h3 id="X_5">5. <i>Valentinus.</i></h3>

<p>13. But Valentinus and those from his school say the
Source of the All is a Father and yet are carried into conflicting
opinions [about him]. For some of them [think]
that he is alone and capable of generation, while others
hold that he is incapable of bringing forth without a female,
and give him as a spouse Sigê, calling him Bythos. From
whom and from his spouse some say that six projections
came into being, [viz.] Nous and Aletheia, Logos and Zoë,
Anthropos and Ecclesia, and that this is the first Ogdoad
which brings forth.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And, again, [they say] that the projections
which were first born within the Limit<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> are called
the things within the Pleroma; but those second, those
<span class="sidenote">p. 490.</span>
without the Pleroma; and those third, those without the
Limit, the offspring of which last exists as the Hysterema.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
But he says that there was born from that which
was projected in the Hysterema, an Aeon, and that this
is the Demiurge, for he does not wish him to be the First
God, but speaks ill both of him and of what came into
being by him. And [he says] that Christ came down
from that which was within the Pleroma for the salvation
of the Spirit that went astray, which dwells in our inner
man, which they say will be saved for the sake of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
indwelling one. But [Valentinus] will not have it that
the flesh will be saved, calling it a “coat of skin” and a
corrupter of mankind. I have described this in epitome,
as one meets with much matter [concerning it] and differing
opinions among them. This then is what Valentinus’
school thinks.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_6">6. <i>Basilides.</i></h3>

<p>14. But Basilides also says that there is a God-Who-Is-Not
who, being non-existent [made] the created world out
<span class="sidenote">p. 491.</span>
of the things that are not. [He says] that a certain seed,
like a grain of mustard-seed was cast down, which contained
within itself the stem, the leaves, the branches [and]
the fruit; or, like a peacock’s egg, contains within itself
a varied multitude of colours, and they say that this is
the seed of the cosmos, from which all things were produced.
For [he says] the seed contained all things within
itself, inasmuch as thus the things that were not were preordained
to come into being by the God-Who-Is-Not.
Then there was, they say, in that seed a Sonhood, tripartite
and in all things of the same substance with the God-Who-Is-Not,
being begotten from the things that were not.
And of this tripartite Sonhood, one part was [itself] finely
divided, another coarsely so, while the other part needed
purification. But the finely-divided part, straightway and
concurrently with the happening of the first casting-down
of the seed by the God-Who-Is-Not, escaped and went on
high and came into the presence of Him-Who-Is-Not. For
every nature yearns for Him because of His superabundance
of beauty, but each in a different way. But the more
coarsely divided [part] abode in the Seed and being merely
imitative could not go on high, for it was much inferior
<span class="sidenote">p. 492.</span>
to the finer part.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> And it was given wings by the Holy
Spirit, for the Sonhood putting them on, both gives and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
receives benefit.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But the third Sonhood has need of
purification. It remains in the heap of the Panspermia
and it gives and receives benefit. And [he says] that there
is something called [the] Cosmos and something hypercosmic
for (the things that are) are divided by him into these two
primary divisions. And what is between them, he calls [the]
Boundary Holy Spirit, having the fragrance of the Sonhood.</p>

<p>From the Panspermia of the heap of the cosmic seed,
there escaped and was brought forth the Great Ruler, the
chief of the Cosmos, [a being] of unspeakable beauty and
greatness. And he, uplifting himself to the firmament
thought there was none other above him. And he became
brighter and mightier than all below him, save the Sonhood
left behind whom he did not know to be wiser than
he. This [Ruler] having turned to the fashioning of the
Cosmos, first begat for himself a Son better than he, and
made him sit at his right hand. And this [place of the
Ruler] they declare the Ogdoad. He then builds the whole
<span class="sidenote">p. 493.</span>
heavenly creation. But another Ruler ascended from the
Panspermia, greater than all those lying beneath save the
Sonhood left behind, but much inferior to the first, and he
is called Hebdomad. He is the Creator and Demiurge
and Controller of all below him; and he also made for
himself a son more foresighted and wiser than he. But all
these, they say, are according to the predetermination of
that One-Who-Is-Not, and are worlds and boundless spaces.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
And [Basilides] says that on Jesus who was born of Mary
the power of [the] Gospel came, which descended and
illumined the Son of the Ogdoad and the Son of the
Hebdomad for the illumination and separation and purification
of the Sonhood left behind that he might benefit
and receive benefits from the souls. And they say that
themselves are sons [of God], who for this purpose are in
the world, [viz.] that they may purify the souls by their
teaching and go on high together with the [third] Sonhood
to the presence of the Father above, from whom the first
Sonhood proceeded.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And they declare that the cosmos
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
shall endure until all the souls together with the Sonhood
shall withdraw [from it]. And Basilides is not ashamed to
narrate these portents.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<h3 id="X_7" title="7. Justinus.">
7. <i>Justinus.</i><a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h3>

<p>15. Justinus also daring to [advance] things like these,
says thus: “There are three unbegotten principles of the
universals, two male [and] one female.” Of the male, one
is a certain principle called the Good, and is alone thus
called, having foreknowledge of the universals. But the
other [male] is the Father of all begotten ones, and has no
foreknowledge and is unknown and unseen and is called,
they say, Elohim. [But] the female is without foreknowledge,
inclined to passion, double-minded, double-bodied,
as in the stories about her<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which we have above related in
detail, the upper parts of her down to the groin being a virgin
and those [below] a viper. The same is called Edem and
Israel. And he declares that these are the principles of the
universals wherefrom all things came into being. And
[he says] that Elohim came without foreknowledge to desire
for the composite virgin, and, companying with her, begat
<span class="sidenote">p. 495.</span>
twelve angels. The names of these are....<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And of
these the paternal ones take sides with the (father); but
the maternal ones with the mother. The same are (the
trees of Paradise)<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> whereof Moses, speaking allegorically,
wrote in the Law. And all things were made by Elohim
and Edem; and the animals together with the rest of
[creation] come from the beast-like parts, but man from
those above the groin. And Edem deposited in [man] the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
soul which is her power (but Elohim the spirit). But he
declares that Elohim having learned [of the light above
him] ascended to the presence of the Good One and left
Edem behind. Whereat she being angered makes every plot
against the spirit of Elohim which is deposited in man.
And for his sake, the Father sent Baruch and commanded
the Prophets (to speak) so that he might set free the spirit
of Elohim and draw all men away from Edem. But he
<span class="sidenote">p. 496.</span>
declares that Heracles became a prophet and that he was
worsted by Omphale, that is by Babel, whom they name
Aphrodite. And at last in the days of Herod Jesus
became the son of Mary and Joseph, to Whom he declares
Baruch to have spoken. And that Edem plotted against
Him, but could not beguile Him, and therefore made Him
to be crucified. Whose spirit [Justinus] says went on
high to the Good One. And thus (the spirits) of all
who believe these silly and feeble stories will be saved;
but the body and soul belonging to Edem, whom the
foolish Justinus calls the Earth,<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> will be left behind.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_8">8. <i>The Docetae.</i></h3>

<p>16. But the Docetae say things like this: That the
first God is as the seed of the fig-tree from whom have
come three Aeons, like the stem and the leaves and
<span class="sidenote">p. 497.</span>
the fruit. And that these have projected thirty Aeons,
each of them (ten). But all are linked together in tens
and only differ in arrangement by some being before
others.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And they projected infinitely boundless Aeons
and are all masculo-feminine. And having taken counsel
they all came together into one and from this intermediate
Aeon was begotten from the Virgin Mary the Saviour of
all, like in all things to the seed of the fig-tree, but inferior
to it in that He was begotten. For the seed whence the
fig-tree [comes] is unbegotten.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This then was the great
light of the Aeons, complete, receiving no setting in order,<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
containing within itself the forms of all the animals. And
[they say] that this [light] shining into the underlying chaos
provided a cause to the things which have been and are,
and descending from on high impressed [on the] chaos
below the forms of the Aeonic exemplars.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> For the third
Aeon which had tripled itself, seeing that all his types were
drawn down into the darkness below and not being
ignorant of the terrible nature of the darkness and the
simplicity of the light, created heaven and having fixed it
between, divided in twain the darkness and the light.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Then all the forms of the third Aeon having been overcome,
<span class="sidenote">p. 498.</span>
they say, by the darkness, his likeness<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> subsisted
as a living fire coming into being by the light. From
which, they say, the Great Ruler came to be, of whom
Moses talks when he says that this God is a fiery God and
a Demiurge who ever transfers the forms<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of all (Aeons)
into bodies. But they declare that it is these souls for
whose sake the Saviour came,<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and showed the way whereby
those that had been overcome may escape. And [they
say] that Jesus did on that unique power, wherefore He
could not be gazed upon by any by reason of the overpowering
greatness of His glory. And they say that all
things happened to Him as is written in the Gospels.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_9">9. <i>Monoimus.</i></h3>

<p>17. But the followers of Monoimus the Arab say that
<span class="sidenote">p. 499.</span>
the principle of the All is a First Man<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and Son of Man,
and that the things which have come to pass as Moses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
says, came into being not by the First Man but by the
Son of Man, and not from the whole, but from part of
him. And that the Son of Man is Iota, which is the
Decad, a dominant number wherein is the substance of all
number, whereby every number subsists, and is the birth
of the All [viz.] Fire, Air, Water [and] Earth. But this
being so, Iota is one and one tittle, a perfect thing from
the Perfect, a tittle flowing from on high, having within
itself whatever also has the Man the Father of the Son of
Man. Therefore [Monoimus] says that the world of Moses
came into being in six days, that is, in six powers, from
which the cosmos came forth from the one tittle. For
cubes and octahedrons and pyramids and all the equal-sided
figures like these, whence are made up Fire, Air, Water [and]
Earth, have came into being from the numbers left behind
in that simple tittle of the Iota which is the Son of Man.
When therefore, he says, Moses speaks of a rod turning
<span class="sidenote">p. 500.</span>
towards Egypt he is attributing allegorically the woes<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
of the world to the Iota, nor does he figure more than the
ten woes. But if, he says, you wish to understand the
All, enquire within thyself who it is who says, “My soul,
my flesh, my mind,”<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and who within thee makes each
thing his own as another does to him. Understand that
this is a perfect thing from the Perfect who considers all
the so-called non-existent and all the existent as peculiar to
himself.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This then is what Monoimus thinks.</p>


<h3 id="X_10">10. <i>Tatian.</i></h3>

<p>18. But Tatian, like Valentinus and the others, says that
there are certain unseen Aeons, by one of whom below the
cosmos and the things that are, were fashioned. And he
practises a very cynical mode of life, and hardly differs
from Marcion in his blasphemies and his rules about
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

11. <i>Marcion.</i><a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></h3>

<p>19. Marcion the Pontian, and Cerdo his teacher, also
determined that there are three principles of the All, a
Good One, a Just One, and Matter. But certain disciples of
theirs add to this, saying that there are a Good One, a Just
One, a Wicked One, and Matter. But all [agree] that the
Good One created nothing wholly;<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but they say that the
Just One, whom some name the Wicked One, but others
merely the Just, made all things out of the underlying
Matter. For he made them not well but absurdly.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> For
things must need be like their creator. Wherefore they
make use of the parable in the Gospels, saying, “A good
tree cannot make evil fruits,”<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and so on, declaring that in
this it is said that things were devised wickedly by [the
Just One]. And he says that Christ is the son of the Good
One and was sent for the salvation of souls. Whom he
calls [the] inner man, saying that He appeared as a man,
<span class="sidenote">p. 502.</span>
but was not man, and as incarnate, but was not incarnate,
and was manifested in appearance [only], but underwent
neither birth nor suffering, but seemed [to do so]. And
[Marcion] does not wish that [the] flesh shall rise again.
And, saying that marriage is destruction, he leads his
disciples to a very Cynical life, thinking thereby to vex the
Demiurge by abstaining from the things brought into being
or laid down by him.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>


<div class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</div>
<h3 id="X_12">12. <i>Apelles.</i></h3>

<p>20. But Apelles, the disciple of [Marcion] displeased
with what was said by his teacher, as we have before said,
proposed by another theory that there are four Gods,
declaring that one is (good) whom the Prophets knew not,
but of whom Christ is the Son. And that another is the
Demiurge of the All, whom he does not wish to be a god,
and another a fiery one who is manifest, and yet another a
wicked one: [all of] whom he calls angels. And adding
Christ to these, he says that He is the fifth. But he gives
heed to a book which he calls <i>Manifestations</i> of a certain
Philumene whom he thinks a prophetess. And he says
<span class="sidenote">p. 503.</span>
that Christ did not receive the flesh from the Virgin, but
from the adjacent substance of the cosmos. Thus he has
written treatises<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> against the Law and the Prophets
attempting to discredit them as false speakers and ignorant
of God. And he says, like Marcion, that [all] flesh will be
destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_13">13. <i>Cerinthus.</i></h3>

<p>21. But Cerinthus, who had been trained in Egypt,
would have it that the cosmos did not come into being by
the First God, but by a certain angelic power far removed
and standing apart from the Authority [set] over the
universals and ignorant of the God over all things. And
he says that Jesus was not begotten from a Virgin, but was
the son of Joseph and Mary in the same way as the rest of
mankind, and that He excelled all other men in righteousness,
moderation and intelligence. And that at the Baptism,
there descended upon Him from the Authority over the
universals, the Christ in the form of a dove, and that He
then preached the unknown God and perfected his powers;<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
<span class="sidenote">p. 504.</span>
but that at the end of the passion the Christ fell away
from Jesus. And Jesus suffered, but the Christ remained
passionless, being a spirit of [the] Lord.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>


<div class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</div>
<h3 id="X_14">14. <i>Ebionæi.</i></h3>

<p>22. But the Ebionæi say that the cosmos came into
being from the true God; but speak of the Christ as does
Cerinthus. And they live in all things according to the
Law of Moses, thus declaring themselves justified.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_15">15. <i>Theodotus.</i></h3>

<p>23. Theodotus the Byzantian brought in another heresy
such as this, declaring that the universals came into being
by the true God. But he says, like the Gnostics before
described, that the Christ appeared in some such fashion
[as this]. He said that the Christ was a man akin to all,
but He differed [from others] in that He by the will of God
was born from a Virgin who had been overshadowed by the
<span class="sidenote">p. 505.</span>
Holy Spirit. And that he was not incarnate in the Virgin,
but at length at the Baptism the Christ descended upon
Jesus in the form of a dove, whence they say He did not
before then exercise powers. But he will not have the
Christ to be God. And so Theodotus.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_16">16. <i>Other Theodotians.</i></h3>

<p>24. And others of them say all things like those aforesaid,
altering one single thing only in that they accept
Melchizedek as some very great power, declaring him to
exist above every power. After whose likeness they will
have the Christ to be.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_17">17. <i>Phrygians.</i></h3>

<p>25. But the Phrygians take the beginnings of their heresy
from one Montanus and Priscilla and Maximilla, thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the wenches prophetesses and Montanus a prophet. But
<span class="sidenote">p. 506.</span>
they are considered to speak rightly in what they say about
the beginning and the fashioning of the All, and they
receive not otherwise the things about the Christ. But
they stumble with those aforesaid to whose words they
erringly give heed rather than to the Gospels, and they
prescribe new and unusual fasts.</p>

<p>26. But others of them approaching the heresy of the
Noetians think in like manner concerning the wenches and
Montanus, but blaspheme the Father of the universals
saying that He is at once Son and Father, seen and unseen,
begotten and unbegotten, mortal and immortal. These
take their starting-points from one Noetus.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_18">18. <i>Noetus.</i></h3>

<p>27. And in the same way Noetus, being a Smyrnæan by
birth, a garrulous and versatile man, brought in this heresy,
which from one Epigonus reached Cleomenes and has so
remained with his successors until now. It says that the
<span class="sidenote">p. 507.</span>
Father and God of the universals is one and that He made
all things, and became invisible to the things which are
when He willed, and then appeared when he wished. And
that He is invisible when He is not seen; but visible when
He is seen; and unbegotten when He is not begotten,
but begotten when He is begotten from a Virgin; and
passionless and immortal when He does not suffer and die,
but that when [the] Passion comes, He suffers and dies.
They think this Father is Himself called Son according to
times and circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The heresy of these persons
Callistus confirmed, whose life we have faithfully set forth.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Who himself gave birth to a heresy, taking starting-points
from them, while himself confessing that this Fashioner
the All is the Father and God; but that He is spoken of by
name and named Son, while in substance He is (one Spirit).
For God, he says is a Spirit not other than the Logos nor
the Logos than God, and therefore this Person is divided
in name indeed, but not in substance. And he names this
one God, and says that He was incarnated. And he wishes
the Son to be He who was seen and overcome according to
<span class="sidenote">p. 508.</span>
the flesh, but the Father to be He who dwelt within [Him].
He sometimes branches off to the heresy of Noetus and
sometimes to that of Theodotus, but holds nothing steadfastly.
This now Callistus.</p>


<h3 id="X_19">19. <i>Hermogenes.</i></h3>

<p>28. But one Hermogenes having also wished to say
something [new] said that God made all things out of
co-existent and underlying matter. For that it is impossible
to hold that God created existing things from those which
are not.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>


<h3 id="X_20">20. <i>Elchasaitae.</i></h3>

<p>29. But certain others, as if bringing in something new
[and] collecting things from all heresies, prepared a foreign
book bearing the name of one Elchasai. These in the
same way [as their predecessors] confess that the principles
of the All came into being by God, but do not confess
Christ to be one. But they say that there is one on high
<span class="sidenote">p. 509.</span>
who is often transferred<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> into [many] bodies, and that he
is now in Jesus. Likewise that at one time, this one was
born from God, and at another became [the] Spirit, and
sometimes was born from a Virgin and sometimes not.
And that thereafter he is ever transferred into [many]
bodies, and is manifested in many according to [the] times.
And they use incantations and baptisms for their confession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of the elements.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And they are excited about astrology

<p>30. (Abraham being commanded) by God, migrates from
Mesopotamia and the city of Harran to the part now called
Palestine and Judæa but then Canaanitis, concerning which
we have in part but not without care handed down the
<span class="sidenote">p. 510.</span>
account in other discourses.<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Through this occurred the
beginning of [the] increase [of population] in Judæa, which
got the name from Judah the fourth son of Jacob, of whom
it was also called the kingdom, through the royal race being
from him. (Abraham)<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> migrates from Mesopotamia (being
75 years old) and being in his hundredth year (begat Isaac).
(And Isaac being) 60 years old begat Jacob. And Jacob
[when] 87 years old begat Levi. But Levi when 40 years
old begat Kohath.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And Kohath [was 4] years old when
he went down with Jacob into Egypt. Therefore the whole
time which Abraham and all his race by Isaac dwelt in the
land then called [the] Canaanitis was 215 years.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> And his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
(father) was Terah. This, one’s [father] was Nahor, his
Serug (his Zeu, his Peleg, his Eber) whence (the Jews) are
<span class="sidenote">p. 511.</span>
called Hebrews. There were 72 (sons of Abraham from
whom also were 72) nations, whose names also we have set
forth in other books.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Nor did we omit this in its place as
we wished to show to the learned<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> our affection concerning
the Divine and the accurate knowledge concerning the
Truth which we have painfully acquired. But the father of
this Eber was Shelah, and his Canaan, and his Arphaxad,
who was born to Shem; and his father was Noah in whose
time the flood over the whole world came to pass, which
neither Egyptians, nor Chaldæans, nor Greeks record. For
to them the floods in the time of Ogyges and Deacalion
were [only] in places. Now in their time<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> were 5 generations,
or 435 years.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This [Noah] being a most pious man
and one who loved God, alone with [his] wife and children
and their three wives escaped the coming flood, being saved
in an ark, the measurements and remains of which, as we
have set forth<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> [elsewhere], are shown to this day in the
<span class="sidenote">p. 512.</span>
mountains called Ararat which are near the land of the
Adiabeni. It is then to be observed by those who wish
to give a painstaking account how plainly it is shown that
the God fearing race are older than all Chaldæans, Egyptians,
[or] Greeks. But what need is there to name here those
before Noah who both feared and spake with God, when
to what has gone before the witness of antiquity is
sufficient?</p>

<p>31. But since it seems not unreasonable to show that
those nations who occupy themselves with philosophy<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> are
later in date than they who feared God, it is right to say
both where their race came from, and that when they
migrated to these countries, they did not take a name from
them, but themselves gained [one] from those who first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
ruled<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and dwelt [there]. The three sons of Noah were
Shem, Ham and Japhet. From them the whole race of
men multiplied and dwelt in every country. For the word
of God<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> was confirmed by them which said, “Increase and
multiply and fill the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> So mighty was this one
saying, that 72 children were begotten by the 3 sons, family
<span class="sidenote">p. 513.</span>
by family, of whom 25 were Shem’s, 15 Japhet’s, and 32
Ham’s. And the sons of Ham were, as has been said 32:&mdash;his
were Canaan, from whom the Canaanites, Misraim, from
whom the Egyptians, Cush, from whom the Ethiopians,
Phut, from whom the Libyans. These in their own speech
unto this day are called by the common name of their
ancestors and even in the Greek are named by the names
by which they have just been called. But if it were shown
that there were formerly none to inhabit their countries,
nor a beginning of [any] race<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> of men, yet there are still
these sons of Noah, a God-fearing man who was himself a
disciple of God-fearing men, thanks to which he escaped
the great although temporary threat of [the] waters. How
then can it be denied that there were God-fearing men
earlier than all Chaldæans, Egyptians [and] Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the
father of which [last] was born to that Japhet [and had the]
name Jovan, whence [the] Greeks and Ionians? And if
the nations who occupy themselves with matters of philosophy
are shown to be altogether of much later date than
the God-fearing race and the Flood, will not the Barbarian
<span class="sidenote">p. 514.</span>
and whatever races in the world are known and unknown,
appear later than these? Wherefore now, do ye Greeks,
Egyptians and Chaldæans and every race of men master this
argument and learn what is the Divine and what His well-ordered
creation from us, the friends of God, who have not
been trained in dainty phrase, but in the knowledge of
Truth and the practice of moderation find words for His
demonstration.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>32. One God is the First and Only One and Creator and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Ruler of all. He has no coæval, neither boundless chaos,
nor immeasureable water, nor solid earth, nor compact air,
nor hot fire, nor subtle spirit, nor the blue canopy of great
heaven.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But He was One, alone with Himself, who when
He willed created the things which are, which at first were
not, save that He willed to create them as knowing of what
they would be. For foreknowledge also is present with
Him. He fashioned first the different principles of things
to come&mdash;fire and spirit,<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> water and earth,&mdash;from which
different [principles] He made His creation. And some
<span class="sidenote">p. 515.</span>
things He [made of] one substance and some he bound
together out of two, others of three and yet others of four.
And those that are of one were immortal, for dissolution
does not dog them, for that which is one will never be
dissolved. But those [made] from two or three or four
[substances] are dissoluble, wherefore they are called
mortal. For death is called this, the dissolution of what
is bound together. We think we have now answered
sufficiently those who have sound perception, who, if for
love of learning they will enquire further into these substances
and the causes of the fashioning of all things, they
will learn them by reading our book, treating of “the
Substance of the All.”<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And I think that it is here enough
to set forth the causes from ignorance whereof the Greeks
glorified with dainty phrase the parts of the creation, but
ignored the Creator. Starting wherefrom the heresiarchs,
transfiguring into like expressions what was formerly said
by [the Greeks] have composed laughable heresies.</p>

<p>33. This God, then, One and Over All having first conceived
<span class="sidenote">p. 516.</span>
in His mind begat [the] Word, not a word in the
sense of a voice, but the indwelling Reason<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of the All.
He begot Him alone from the things which are. For the
Father Himself was what is, from Whom was the Word, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
cause of the begetting of things coming into being, bearing
within Himself the will of His begetter, not ignorant of the
thought of the Father. For from the time<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of His coming
forth from Him who begat Him, becoming His first-born
voice, He holds within Himself the ideas conceived in His
Father’s mind. Whence, on the Father ordering the world
to come into being, the Word completed it in detail,<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> [thus]
pleasing God. And the things which multiply by generation,
He formed male and female; but all those for service and
ministry he made either males who have no need of females
or neither male nor female. For when the first substances
<span class="sidenote">p. 517.</span>
of these came into being [namely] Fire and Spirit, Earth
and Water, from the things that were not, neither male nor
female things existed. Nor could male and female have
come forth from each of these, unless the God who gave the
command had willed that the Word should do this service.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
I confess that angels are [formed] of fire and I say that no
females are present with them. But I consider that Sun
and Moon and stars were in like manner [formed] of fire
and spirit and are neither male nor female. But I say that
swimming animals were [formed] of water and that winged
ones are male and female.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> For thus God willed and commanded
that the watery substance should be fruitful. In
like manner, serpents and wild beasts and all sorts of
animals were [formed] from earth and are male and female;
for this the nature of begotten things allowed. For whatever
things He willed, those God created. These He
fashioned by the Word, for they could not have come into
being otherwise than they did. But when as He had willed
He also created, He called and designated them by name.
Thereafter He fashioned the ruler of them all, and equipped
him from all substances brought together. Nor did He wish
to make a God and fail, nor an angel&mdash;be not deceived&mdash;but
<span class="sidenote">p. 518.</span>
a man. For had God willed to make thee a God, He
could: thou hast the example of the Word. But He willed
a man and created thee a man. But if thou dost wish also
to become a God, hearken to the Creator and withstand
Him not now, so that being found faithful over a little,
thou mayest be entrusted with much.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Only the Word of this [God] is from Him. Wherefore
He also is God, being the substance of God. But the
world is from nothing. Wherefore it is not God and it will
be dissolved<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> when the Creator wills. But God who
created makes nothing evil; but he creates it fair and good.
For He who creates is good. But man when he came into
being was an animal with free-will,<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> not having a ruling
mind, nor dominating all things by reflection and authority
and power, but a slave<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and full of all contrary [desires].<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Who, in that he is free to choose produces evil, which when
it is completed by accident is nothing unless thou dost
make [it].<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> For it is by the thinking and willing something
<span class="sidenote">p. 519.</span>
evil, that it is named evil; which was not from the beginning,
but came into being later. [And] as man was free to
choose, a Law was laid down by God, not vainly. For if
man were not free to will or not to will, what need of a
Law?<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> For the Law is not decreed for a dumb beast, but
a bridle and a whip; but to man was appointed a commandment
and a penalty in respect of what he was to do
and not to do. And [the] Law as to this was laid down of
old through righteous men. Nearer to our own times, a
Law full of majesty and justice was laid down through the
Moses aforesaid, a steadfast man and one who loved God.</p>

<p>All these things, the Word of God directs, the First-born
Son of [the] Father, the light-bringing voice before dawn.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Thereafter there came into being righteous men who loved
God. These were called prophets from their showing
beforehand the things to come.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> To whom word came not
at one season [only], but through all generations the utterances
of things foretold was most clearly brought forward.<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 520.</span>
Nor did they merely give an answer to those present there
at the time, but through several generations also the things
to come were foreshadowed. [And this] because speaking
of things past they recalled them to mankind; but by
showing what was then happening they put away carelessness,
and by foretelling the future have made every one of us
fearful by the sight of the fulfilment of prophecies and the
expectation of the future. Such is our faith, O all ye men
who are not persuaded by vain speeches, nor captured by
sudden movings of the heart, nor enchanted by plausible
and eloquent words, but have not been obdurate to words
uttered by Divine power. And these things God commanded
[the] Word; and the Word speaking through [the
prophets], uttered them for the turning of man from disobedience
and emancipating him from the force of Fate, but
calling him to liberty by his free choice.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The Father in the last days sent forth this Word, not
speaking through a prophet, and not wishing that the Word
when proclaimed should be darkly guessed at, but that He
should be manifested to the very eyes of all. He, I say,
<span class="sidenote">p. 521.</span>
(sent Him forth) that the world when it beheld Him should
be put to shame. For He did not give commandment
through the person of prophets, nor affright [the] soul by an
angel, but was Himself present and spake. Him we know
to have taken body from a Virgin and to have moulded<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
the old man through a new formation. [We know] that He
passed in life through every age,<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> so that He might become
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
a law for every age, and that His presence might show forth
His manhood as an example<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to all men; and that through
Him it might be proved that God makes nothing evil, and
that man as master of himself can will or not will [evil],
being capable of both. We know, too, that this man came
into being out of the same material<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> as ourselves; for were
He not of the same [matter] it would be vain to order that
the Teacher be imitated. For had that Man chanced to be
of another substance [than ours] why should he order
me who am weak by nature to do things like Himself?
And [in that case] how is He good and just? But in order
that He might not be thought different from us, He underwent
toil, and was willing to hunger, and denied not thirst,<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
and was stilled in sleep, and renounced not suffering, and
<span class="sidenote">p. 522.</span>
submitted to death, and manifested resurrection, sacrificing
in all this His own manhood, so that thou when suffering
may not be faint-hearted, but mayst confess thyself a man
and expect also what the Father promised Him.</p>

<p>34. Such is the true word about the Divine.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> O all ye
men, Greeks and Barbarians, Chaldæans and Assyrians,
Egyptians and Libyans, Indians and Ethiopians, Celts and
ye army-leading Latins,<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and all ye dwellers in Europe,
Asia and Libya.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> To you I am become a counsellor, being
a disciple of the Word who loves man and myself a lover of
mankind, so that you may hasten to be taught by us who is
the real God and what His well-ordered creation. And
that you give not heed to the sophistries of artificial discourses,<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
nor to the crazy promises of plagiarizing heretics,
but to the august simplicity of unboastful truth. Through
the knowledge of which, you shall escape the coming
menace of the judgment of fire, and the unlighted vision of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
gloomy Tartarus unillumined by the voice of the Word, and
<span class="sidenote">p. 523.</span>
the boiling of the Lake of the eternal Gehenna of flame, and
the ever-threatening eye of the angels punished in Tartarus,<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and the worm which through the filth of the body turns
towards the body which threw it forth as for food. And
these things thou shalt escape when thou hast been taught
the God Who Is. And thou shalt have an immortal body
together with an incorruptible soul. And thou shalt receive
the kingdom of the heavens, who whilst on earth didst also
recognize the heavenly King. But thou shall speak with
God and be joint heir with Christ, not enslaved by desires
nor sufferings nor diseases.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> For thou [wilt] have become
God. For whatever sufferings thou underwent as man,
thou hast shown that thou art a man; but whatever is
appurtenant to a God, that God has promised to bestow,
because thou hast been made divine, since thou hast been
begotten immortal. This is the [true] “Know Thyself,”
the knowledge of the Creator God. For to him who knows
himself has occurred the being known to Him by whom
<span class="sidenote">p. 524.</span>
he is called. Wherefore now, O men, be not your own
enemies, nor hesitate to turn again. For Christ is the God
over all, Who has arranged to wash away iniquity from
among men, and to make anew the old man who from the
beginning was called His image, thus showing forth His
love towards thee. Having hearkened to Whose august
precepts, and having become a good imitator of the Good
One, thou wilt be like unto and be honoured by Him.
For God asks no alms,<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and has made thee God for His
own glory.</p>


<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_718" href="#FNanchor_718" class="label">[1]</a> The promises before noted at the end of Books VIII and IX to
declare the Doctrine of Truth says nothing of these epitomes, nor do
they always accord with the earlier Books which may be supposed to
be here epitomized. For a suggested explanation of this discrepancy
see Introduction, Vol. I, pp. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_18">18</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_19">19</a> <i>supra</i>. It should also be noted that,
while the author omits here any detailed mention of the contents of Books
II, III, and IV, he can hardly have had Book I before his eyes at the time
of writing, or he would have referred to it directly instead of quoting as
he does from Sextus Empiricus. As has been said in the Introduction,
the “epitome of the heresies” bears closer relation to Books V-IX,
although it omits several heresies included in the epitomized books.
That the writer, if not Hippolytus himself, is at any rate writing in his
name, is plain from the wording of chap. 5, <i>infra</i>, and we can hardly
suppose a forger so reckless as not to have read the earlier Books before
attempting to epitomize them. On the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable
that Hippolytus had in his possession notes from which his
earlier Books were written, and that of these only a part remained when
he set to work to write Book X. It would seem, therefore, that only
some such hypothesis as that given in the Introduction really fits the
case.</p>

<p>As to the style of the Book it does not differ materially from that of
the others, save in one particular. This is the frequent omission of the
definite article, which is so frequent as to arouse suspicion that the
scribe may have been here translating from a Latin rather than
copying from a Greek original.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_719" href="#FNanchor_719" class="label">[2]</a> This is the main reason for supposing that this Book is that called
the <i>Labyrinth</i> which Photius says was by the author of the work
<i>On the Universe</i>, attributed by the list on the chair to Hippolytus.

<p><a id="Footnote_722" href="#FNanchor_722" class="label">[5]</a> Book I only is concerned with the teachings of the Greek philosophers;

have contained an exposition of the mystic rites and astrological doctrine,
and Book IV is entirely taken up with magic and divination. This is
confirmed by the statement in Vol. I, p. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65478/65478-h/65478-h.htm#Page_119">119</a>. Hippolytus must therefore

Sextus Empiricus’ work, <i>Adversus Physicos</i>, c. 10. So close is this
that we are able by its aid to correct by it the faulty text of Sextus, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. Sextus, as a sceptic, was of course as much opposed to the
study of nature as Hippolytus, and was therefore only interested in
showing the discrepancies among its teachers. But how does this make
the quotation from him an “epitome”?</p>

have had before him either the whole of Book V or the notes from
which it was written. We may see, therefore, from this, what his idea
of an epitome is. He does not try to condense his former statements
so as to give us a bird’s-eye view of the whole heresy, but picks out
from them a few sentences which seem to him of special importance.
Hence it is only useful to us as a means of checking the text, and brings
us no nearer to an appreciation of the doctrines of the sect.</p>

p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a> <i>supra</i>. He now omits all reference to Justin Martyr, there said to
be Tatian’s teacher, and to Tatian’s peculiar ideas about the salvation

in Book VII, pp. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>, <a href="#Page_94">94</a> <i>supra</i>. The summarizer adds to it the alleged
denial by Theodotus of Christ’s divinity, which does not appear in
Book VII.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_784" href="#FNanchor_784" class="label">[67]</a> This, too, is not inconsistent with the account of “other Theodotians”
in Book VII, pp <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, <a href="#Page_95">95</a> <i>supra</i>, but omits all reference to the
Nicolaitans.</p>

<div class="footnote">

which his account of the Phrygians or Montanists appears to be taken.
The phrases used are not identical, and while Book VIII merely says
that the Montanist heresy agrees with the Patripassianism of the
Noetian, the Summary declares that the first was absolutely derived
from the second.</p>

κατὰ χρόνων τροπήν, p. 434 Cr. Otherwise this chapter seems to be
a condensed paraphrase rather than a series of extracts from Book IX,
the summarizer having here added together the “heresies” so called
of Noetus and Callistus. As mentioned in the Introduction, he is
careful not to mention that Callistus was a Pope, and in the last
sentence but one, he omits the name of Sabellius which is mentioned
in the earlier book. Cf. p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a> <i>supra</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_791" href="#FNanchor_791" class="label">[74]</a> Cruice suggests that the considerable lacuna that there evidently
is here was filled by a summary of the chapters on the Jewish sects
with which Book IX ends (see pp. 455-472 Cr.). This hardly seems
to correspond with the form of what is left; but it is not impossible
that we have here excerpts from the book on chronology which we
know Hippolytus to have written. Another suggestion is that what
follows is from his <i>Commentary on Genesis</i>, of which a few fragments
survive.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_825" href="#FNanchor_825" class="label">[108]</a> Cruice points out the likeness between this doctrine of the Word
speaking through the Prophets, and that with which Origen begins his
treatise, Περὶ Ἀρχῶν (I, § 1), that before the Incarnation “Christ, the
Word of God, was in Moses and the prophets.” It was doubtless this,
and the likeness between the theory of the origin of evil as given on
pp. 518, 519 Cr. of our text, and that of Origen <i>in Joann</i>, II, 7, 8,
which caused some commentator to write in the margin of the Codex,
Ὠριγένης καὶ Ὠριγένους δόξα: “Origen and Origen’s opinions.” The
words used in the two cases are too unlike to suggest any identity of
authorship or conscious borrowing; but it is perfectly probable that
Origen when in Rome communicated with Hippolytus as head of the
Greek-speaking community there, and that they had many ideas in
common. This would account at once for the likeness between the
passages noted and for the confusion between Hippolytus and Origen as
the author of the <i>Philosophumena</i>, while it throws new light on Origen’s
condemnation for heresy.</p>

Cruice suggests δὲ γὰρ πολυωρεῖ, “has a great esteem for thee.”
Wordsworth translates “has a longing for thee.” Macmahon “(by
such signal condescension) does not diminish aught of the dignity of
His divine perfection.” The phrase is probably an allusion to the
heathen notion formally stated by Aelius Aristides and others that the
gods <i>had need</i> of the sacrifices of mortals.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
